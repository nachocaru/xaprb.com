Hi! I hope you are finding this blog helpful and enjoyable.

A few words about me. I am Baron Schwartz, the lead author of [High Performance MySQL][1], among other things. My online nickname Xaprb is my first name typed in QWERTY on a Dvorak keyboard layout.

In addition to my writing, I've created quite a bit of open-source software. I speak frequently. Please contact me if you would like me to address your organization.

You can contact me like this: `SELECT REVERSE( 'moc.brpax@norab');` Please do not ask me about advertising or guest posting on this blog, and please don't send me solicitations for service provider offerings, outsourcing, etc. I will mark your email as spam.

I also invite you to connect with me on [Twitter][2] and [LinkedIn][3].
