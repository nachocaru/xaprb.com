I'm a big fan of [pair Networks][1], my hosting company. Their service has been outstanding; the few times I've ever had a glitch with my shared hosting, they have been responsive beyond the call of duty and done whatever it takes to fix the issue. I use them to host not only a half-dozen of my own sites, but family and client sites as well, plus some other groups I'm involved with. It has been a uniformly excellent experience.

Now I see [pair Networks has gone carbon-neutral][2] too. While such labels can be abused, and I wouldn't really trust this announcement from just anyone, I trust them. I'm happy to see them trying to reduce their environmental impact. Go pair, go!

Side note: pair is not the cheapest (and [I'm accepting gifts][3] if you feel the urge), but every other hosting provider I've heard people rave about for cheapness eventually ends up being a sore point -- even the biggest in the industry -- I'll name no names. Sometimes there's no way to know if someone is good without trying them for six months and seeing how they handle problems. I am also involved with enterprises that use [Blue Ridge InternetWorks][4], who is also top-notch and employs a number of people I respect a lot.
