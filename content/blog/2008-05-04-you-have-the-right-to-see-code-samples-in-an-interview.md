Joel Spolsky writes about [12 steps to better code][1], and elsewhere about how [candidates should write code in interviews][2].

The reverse conditions are true, too. If you&#8217;re a candidate, you should evaluate the employer against the 12 steps, **and you should also see code samples**. How else will you know what you&#8217;re getting into? You really have the right to do this, and you should exercise the right. If you don&#8217;t, you&#8217;ll get stuck in a crap job maintaining crap code. [dramatic voice] It happened to me.

In many companies, you can see code they&#8217;ve released as open-source. (The fact that they&#8217;ve done this says a lot about them.) But in others, you&#8217;re going to need to surprise someone and say &#8220;pick some code that&#8217;s not sensitive and show it to me.&#8221; Something simple, like the HTML for the search form on their website, or a utility to do some systems administration task. Any company is going to have a lot of code like this that they can show you.

The other approaches I see are to ask about it, assume, or ask the interviewer to write some code for you.

1.  Asking is a valid approach. If you see hesitation, or if someone says &#8220;well, it&#8217;s not as nice as we&#8217;d like, and we&#8217;re hoping you will offset that&#8221; run don&#8217;t walk, is my advice. If you&#8217;re reading this as you consider your first job out of college or something, I strongly suggest not getting a job with a company that wants you to improve the way they do things. You should be learning from them, not vice versa.
2.  You can also assume. &#8220;Oh, they use Perl? Nevermind.&#8221; That&#8217;s a stupid approach. Really. Is it acceptable to judge people&#8217;s character by the color of their skin? Then why would you judge their code by the language? In all seriousness, I have actually written very elegant, clean VBScript. And I mean, good-quality code by anyone&#8217;s standards. It&#8217;s hard in VBScript. It&#8217;s easy in Perl if you [follow the Dog][3], which is a sign of great intelligence. Think about it this way: people who write beautiful Perl are people you should be eager to work with; they are rocket scientists. You will be the dumbest person in the room, and that should make you happy.
3.  I&#8217;ve never asked an interviewer to write code for me. Let me know how it works out for you.
