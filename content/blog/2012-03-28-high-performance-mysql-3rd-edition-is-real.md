O&#8217;Reilly authors get 10 copies of their own books for free, and my copies of the third edition of High Performance MySQL arrived yesterday. Now it&#8217;s official! It feels nice to actually hold it in my hand.

A few people have asked me about messages from Amazon saying that their ship date has changed. I don&#8217;t know anything about that; maybe Amazon just made a wild guess the first time and now they actually know something more realistic. Or maybe [the book][1] is more popular than expected? It&#8217;s currently at position #10 in the SQL category on Amazon, which seems pretty good to me. No &#8220;DaVinci Code&#8221; to be sure, but not bad for a technical book.
