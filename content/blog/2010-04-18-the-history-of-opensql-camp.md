I got a couple of questions and comments about [OpenSQL Camp][1] in the past week, and I thought it would be worth noting down the history, because I think there is some difference in perception and memory about this series of events. The following is only my point of view.

### What is OpenSQL Camp?

I can say what I had in mind when I created the original event, but this is bigger than me, so I don&#8217;t get to dictate anything. I wanted a free technical event created entirely by and for a community of open-source databases, in an inclusive sense. Not created or heavily influenced by someone employed by a corporation whose job title includes the word &#8220;Community,&#8221; but really by a community themselves. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with Community So-And-So employed at a corporation, but they are by nature a liaison with that company, and it&#8217;s not the same thing. My original [blog post about this topic][2] is probably the clearest explanation of what I had in mind.

### Who controls it?

Nobody. That&#8217;s right &#8212; I deliberately abdicated control over things. I wanted it to be decentralized. Centralization is a problem; decentralization prevents problems. As just one example, Sheeri Cabral owns opensqlcamp.org the last I saw, and Technocation tends to be the default conduit for all things financial.

If someone wants to take things in a new direction, then they can do so. I don&#8217;t know if anyone would show up for an event that didn&#8217;t really match the spirit that I think is lodged in people&#8217;s minds now, but there is no stick you can brandish, other than threat of negative publicity.

### What&#8217;s the relationship with MySQL Camp?

Nothing whatsoever. MySQL Camp was a series of mini-conferences about MySQL, a particular open-source database. There the resemblance ends. OpenSQL Camp is not &#8220;the same thing under a different name,&#8221; and it&#8217;s not even &#8220;the continuation of MySQL Camp.&#8221; It&#8217;s not even a MySQL event. If you want to look at a particular MySQL event and see where a seed was planted, look to the commercial MySQL conference, not the free MySQL Camp; but you&#8217;d be much better off looking at [beCamp][3] as a root than anything to do with MySQL.

### If MySQL Camp wasn&#8217;t the origin, what was?

I created OpenSQL Camp to set off in a new direction. However, the idea was not fully my own. A brief timeline begins in the Spring of 2008, after I&#8217;d been to a few MySQL Camp events and could see that something was lacking:

1.  After O&#8217;Reilly/MySQL co-hosted MySQL Conference and Expo (a large commercial event) that year, there was a bit of dissatisfaction amongst a few people about the increasingly commercial and marketing-oriented nature of that conference. Some people refused to call the conference by its new name (Conference and Expo) and wanted to put pressure on MySQL to keep it a MySQL User&#8217;s Conference.
2.  [I pointed out that this wasn&#8217;t going to work][2] and said that if we wanted a user&#8217;s conference, we needed to take matters into our own hands.
3.  [Peter Zaitsev][4] agreed, and together with [Arjen Lentz][5], created and announced a new Google Group to discuss the matter.
4.  Discussion happened on the new [mailing list][6].
5.  After a while, I concluded that the discussion was not headed in a direction that&#8217;d really make anything happen. There were simply too many different visions of what was needed, and some of them I strongly disliked, so I stopped contributing.
6.  I privately decided (with my wife&#8217;s consent) to go ahead and organize what I wanted to see. I drew on a couple of people in my hometown who organized a small conference called [beCamp][3] and got things going. I found a venue, initial sponsors, did some initial work on things like catering, and got speakers to commit to presentations.
7.  Once I had a reasonable amount of support from speakers, and had firmly reserved the venue and date, [I announced the event][7].
8.  Pretty quickly thereafter, a flood of help arrived. In particular, Sheeri and my wife really carried the project forward and did far more work than I did. I might be mixing up the timeline; Sheeri might have already been helping before the public announcement, I&#8217;m not sure. Brian Aker and others really used their networks to get more support behind the project.
9.  Two more events were held in 2009, and I had absolutely nothing to do with organizing them, which I think is *awesome*.

### When is the next event?

I heard a rumor this past week that planning for at least one event is in progress, but isn&#8217;t public yet. I had not heard this news until then myself, which again I think is awesome. This is exactly the point: nobody needs to get approval from any &#8220;authority&#8221; to run these things.

### Surprise isn&#8217;t very community oriented, is it?

This entire conference was born out of an &#8220;I see a lot of talk but no action&#8221; kind of situation. I generally don&#8217;t believe in surprise when a community is involved, but sometimes there is a lot of chatter, and talk is actually preventing action &#8212; to get things to happen, you actually have to stop talking. These events were born out of my realization that two things were true:

1.  There was an invitation and call to action but nobody took it, so I didn&#8217;t need to feel bad about going off and doing something myself.
2.  If I tried to involve anyone in the early stages of planning, it would just regress back to the arguments over differing visions of the event.

Sometimes, it&#8217;s simply time to shut up and do stuff.
