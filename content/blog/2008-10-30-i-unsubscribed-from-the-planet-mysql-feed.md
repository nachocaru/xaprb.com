Now why would I do that, especially when my blog is syndicated through it?

Simple. I&#8217;m always trying to cut back on RSS and other &#8220;stuff.&#8221; Less is more. But don&#8217;t worry &#8212; I subscribed again. Only this time, I subscribed to my own filtered version of it! I built it via [Yahoo! Pipes][1]. And I [made it public][2], so you can subscribe to it too.

So what&#8217;s wrong with Planet MySQL?

Well&#8230; have you noticed how much airheaded marketing fluff has been pumped into the feed lately? It&#8217;s like some marketing droid handed down the order from on high, telling every marketing sub-droid to start writing clueless posts promoting things they don&#8217;t understand. So I have filtered out a few choice items. I have cut out the stuff I consider fluffy and/or bovine feces. And anyone who writes things I think are fluffy in the future, will get the axe too. Less is more.

Let me know if you subscribe to it. Feel free to suggest further filters.

**Update** being on the cut-list isn&#8217;t meant to say I think you are fluff or B.F. I also cut out some things I don&#8217;t find interesting from a technical standpoint. Sorry if I offended anyone (though I did mean to send a message to the marketing humanoids).
