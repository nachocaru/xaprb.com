I&#8217;ll be presenting at the [Southern Computer Measurement Group&#8217;s meeting on Thursday][1]. I&#8217;ll discuss how to extract scalability and performance metrics from TCP/IP packet headers. Registration is inexpensive, but it&#8217;s even less if you register by Monday. There is a full schedule of other good talks</a> &#8212; it is an all-day meeting.
