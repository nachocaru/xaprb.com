I'll be presenting at the [Southern Computer Measurement Group's meeting on Thursday][1]. I'll discuss how to extract scalability and performance metrics from TCP/IP packet headers. Registration is inexpensive, but it's even less if you register by Monday. There is a full schedule of other good talks</a> &#8212; it is an all-day meeting.
