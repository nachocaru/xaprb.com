I&#8217;ll be joining Percona for a free day of MySQL education and insight at their upcoming [Percona University Washington DC event on September 12th][1]. My topic is accessing MySQL from Google&#8217;s Go programming language. I&#8217;ve learned a lot about this over the past year or so, and hopefully I can help you get a quick-start. 
If you&#8217;re not familiar with Go, it&#8217;s the darling of the Hacker News crowd these days. Anything with &#8220;Go&#8221; in its title gets to the front page for at least a little while! Go is a great systems programming language. It&#8217;s safe to say I&#8217;ve fallen in love with it, and it&#8217;s now my favorite programming language of all those I&#8217;ve used over my entire career. I chose it because it&#8217;s ideally suited for VividCortex&#8217;s agent programs (zero dependencies, compiled, lightweight, high performance, robust, makes concurrency easy and safe), and we&#8217;re using it for our API servers and backend processing jobs for many of the same reasons. 
There&#8217;s a lot of great content at these free Percona University events. If you&#8217;re not near Washington DC, you should sign up for Percona&#8217;s [conferences and training newsletter][2] so you find out about the next one near you.
