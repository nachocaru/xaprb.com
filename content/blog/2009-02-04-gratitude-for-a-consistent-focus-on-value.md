I&#8217;ve been going through some old stuff that got thrown into a big cardboard box during my move in September. In particular there are a lot of papers from my desk &#8212; old notes I&#8217;d scratched down, legal pads full of notes taken during phone conversations, and so on.

Reading through these old conversations brings them back to me. There are notes from my first &#8220;non-interview&#8221; with [Alan Rimm-Kaufman of The Rimm-Kaufman Group][1]. (That non-interview led to me leave my previous job and join his company.) And lots and lots of notes on conversations I&#8217;ve had with others at the Rimm-Kaufman Group. And there&#8217;s a napkin with scribblings from when [Peter and Vadim][2] and I were riding in a car last April &#8212; the first time we&#8217;d gotten to talk alone together since I joined Percona, although I&#8217;d gotten to know them somewhat during an [intense writing project][3] that spanned a year.

One of the things that&#8217;s really neat about reading through notes from the past 3.5 years is seeing what changes over that time. For example, I&#8217;m seeing things I was working on that I&#8217;m not even involved in anymore. But even more striking is what doesn&#8217;t change at all.

To put it briefly, their focus on values is completely consistent over time &#8212; I see refinements, but the deepest core is constant. Their values come from who they fundamentally are, and they don&#8217;t change. Reading these notes from our conversations is just like reading notes I might have written a few days ago. This is a real source of inspiration and gratitude to me.

Here are some samples, slightly paraphrased because I&#8217;m expanding my shorthand back into real sentences:

*   I believe that people are best at what they enjoy doing. Employees having fun and making money provide a unique value to customers.
*   The best way to deliver value is to match your pay to the benefits of what you deliver, so there is only one motive and it&#8217;s aligned to the customer&#8217;s interests.
*   Your career should be what you love.
*   Open communications. There should never be a punishment for speaking what you feel.
*   Non-experts have a lot to teach us.
*   You should have a stake in the outcome.

I won&#8217;t say which quote came from whom. It doesn&#8217;t matter &#8212; any of them could have said these things. And a lot of people say such things, but the fruits of their labors bear witness to their true belief in these principles. This just supports me in my own convictions. I hope I provide good support in return.

From these conversations I have turned down many paths I might not have otherwise taken: reading [Let My People Go Surfing][4] and countless other books, for example. One of the things I love about this cycle of reinforcement is seeing the businesses follow this leadership, both internally and externally. And when I feel like I&#8217;m not aligned with my own values, I can have a conversation with one of the people whom I know share my values, and they help me find where the disconnect is and get back on track again.

Here&#8217;s an example: a [a recent post on pricing][5] from Peter, and [one from Alan from a while ago][6]. They both understand that the pricing model drives the behavior towards the customer, and they&#8217;ve both aligned with the customer&#8217;s benefit. It&#8217;s completely consistent because it&#8217;s truly who they are.

One of the other neat things about working with such people is their intense practicality. I am sometimes motivated so much towards what I feel is right, that I need their help to see a clear answer to the question &#8220;how much does this matter? What&#8217;s a good balance?&#8221; They help me to stay more centered.

These people have been and continue to be sources of inspiration and strength for me. Thanks!
