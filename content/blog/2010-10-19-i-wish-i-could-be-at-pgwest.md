I wish I could go to [PGWest][1] this year. A lot of great work has been done on PostgreSQL in the last year and a half. There's a new release with built-in replication, and there are in-place upgrades. That solves two of what I think are its three biggest shortcomings in many large-scale database deployments. (Lack of index-only queries is the third shortcoming.)

PGWest is the first major conference about Postgres since the 9.0 release, so all the cool stuff is happening there. I encourage MySQL users to go to it as well &#8212; there is a lot to learn from PostgreSQL. Just remember to be polite and don't start, encourage, or tolerate any sniping between MySQL and Postgres fans.
