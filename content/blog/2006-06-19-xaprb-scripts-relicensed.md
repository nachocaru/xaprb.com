I have re-licensed some of my scripts under the [LGPL][1], which means you can use them as part of other non-GPL software.

The scripts in question are:

*   [JavaScript number formatting][2]
*   [JavaScript date/time formatting and parsing][3]
*   [JavaScript date/time chooser][4] for HTML documents
*   [JavaScript &#8220;combo box&#8221; simulation][5]

### Why the change?

I&#8217;ve always released my work under the GPL, but now that I&#8217;m writing and making available smaller scripts that might be used as part of a larger software system, the GPL isn&#8217;t as appropriate, because of the licensing requirements it places on the rest of the systems with which the scripts may be used.

I&#8217;m not making the decision casually. I&#8217;m a firm believer in [free software][6], as in software freedom. Not only should software be open and un-encumbered by restrictions, but this freedom should be guaranteed even to the extent of prohibiting someone from making a restricted non-free work based on it. Software is encoded knowledge that belongs to humanity as a whole, just as certainly as mathematical formulae. That&#8217;s why I oppose non-free software and software patents.

However, for certain small scripts I&#8217;ve written, this rigid approach doesn&#8217;t make sense. I&#8217;m not releasing these scripts as &#8220;software.&#8221; The scripts mainly serve as working examples of principles and methods I&#8217;m trying to illustrate. From that point of view, the knowledge encoded in the scripts is already free &#8212; it&#8217;s in the articles I write to introduce the scripts, techniques and algorithms. Plus, I&#8217;m not breaking any new ground with the articles, either. Nothing I say here is revolutionary.

I read Richard Stallman&#8217;s writing carefully. Though he has a reputation for being a hard-liner, I value his opinions and judgement highly. When I&#8217;ve had contact with him, he&#8217;s come across just as he does in his essays: as a man of principles, which he will not yield. I respect that. One of his essays is about [*not* using the LGPL][7]. For the reasons stated above, I don&#8217;t think the points raised in that essay are applicable to the scripts I&#8217;ve released on this website. I believe these scripts are best released under a more permissive license.

### The future

This is also a forward-looking change. I&#8217;m not trying to be grandiose about these little scripts I&#8217;ve written. They&#8217;re small snippets and they won&#8217;t change the world. But I&#8217;ve been working on some other things that are more significant, and I want everything I release to be licensed consistently with my beliefs. When I release these other projects, I&#8217;ll be careful to license them in accordance with what they are, what they do, and how others might find them useful.

I hope you, or the projects you&#8217;re working on, will find my work useful. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions, comments, or improvements.
