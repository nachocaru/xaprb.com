After a long time working mostly on [Maatkit][1] and neglecting [innotop][2], Aaron Racine has stepped forward to take over the development. I moved it off Sourceforge (for the same reasons I moved Maatkit) and onto Google Code. Aaron has set up mailing lists and so on, and there is a discussion about which features to add and change. Your input is welcomed on the mailing lists!
