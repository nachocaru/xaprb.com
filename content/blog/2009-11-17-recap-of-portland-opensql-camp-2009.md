I was at [OpenSQL Camp 2009 in Portland][1] last weekend. I thought the event was very well done. On Friday we had a pizza party at Old Town Pizza, which was awesome. Saturday and Sunday were breakfast, sessions, lunch (yum), and sessions and hacking. These were held at [souk][2], a co-working space. After 5PM, people got together for dinner, beer, etc.

I presented on mk-query-digest &#8212; a live demo of features requested by the audience. Sessions from others that I thought were particularly good included ones on CouchDB and MongoDB. I mixed up the time and missed the session from Tokutek on how fractal tree indexes work. I'll try to watch the video if that one was taped.

During the hackathons, Daniel and I worked on Maatkit. We are laying groundwork for a more powerful mk-query-digest.

As you may know, I created OpenSQL Camp. But I was not involved in organizing this or the previous event in Germany, which I think is great. I talked briefly with Eric and Selena about seeing if we could put together a recipe to make the process easy for folks to organize their own. We should be able to lay out checklists and timelines of major things &#8212; location, shirts, sponsorship, budgeting, food. Eric and Selena got great food, much better than the Panera catering I had for the first event. Those kinds of decisions and results should be recorded. It would be great to be able to treat it like a franchise so anyone could just add water and make their own.

I also might be willing to help organize another on the East Coast, perhaps as soon as next year if I can reduce my workload enough to have the time. I'd probably want to do something in or near Washington DC, which is a more convenient location with better public transport than my hometown of Charlottesville.

It all started out as a response to [complaints][3] about MySQL's annual conference not being a user's conference, but nobody actually doing anything about it. I decided to do something about it, in a more inclusive way. And judging by the attendees and talks at the two I've gone to, people were happy to say yes to that. I think if there are continued events, that's the ultimate measure of success.
