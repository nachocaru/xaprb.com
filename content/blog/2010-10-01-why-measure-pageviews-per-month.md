I don&#8217;t get why companies talk about how many pageviews they get per month. Maybe it is a handy metric when thinking about revenue, but when thinking about performance, it&#8217;s not a convenient way to measure.

For example, &#8220;we get 50M page views per month.&#8221; Let&#8217;s translate that into something useful for an engineer: 20 page views per second. How about 2.5B pageviews per month? Roughly 1000 per second.

Much easier to think about what this means. And not so impressive.
