One of the most rewarding things you can do is help someone get a great job or hire a great person for the position they need to fill. I have traveled a lot, written books, done a bunch of consulting, and spoken widely on MySQL, other databases, open source, and so forth. I&#8217;ve gotten to know a lot of people, some I&#8217;d call good friends, and many of them are leading large organizations. I think this is both a privilege and a serious responsibility.

It&#8217;s a privilege because I can ask some of these people for help or introductions or advice sometimes. It&#8217;s a responsibility because I need to be ready to do something for them, too. In many cases it&#8217;s a pay-it-forward kind of readiness.

Many, many people contact me looking for people to hire. I keep a list. When someone tells me they are on the job market, I try to match them with openings I&#8217;m aware of, if any are appropriate. (Many fewer people tell me they&#8217;re looking for jobs than tell me they&#8217;re trying to recruit.)

These are my friends, on both sides. I don&#8217;t introduce people unless I think everyone is really genuinely bringing something great to the table. A great position &#8212; a great talent &#8212; the right circumstances and attitudes.

When I do introduce people, I usually do it one-sidedly, depending on the situation. For example, I&#8217;ll forward the candidate&#8217;s resume and contact information sometimes, with a few words of introduction. At other times I&#8217;ll just BCC the candidate. Or I might send the recruiting party&#8217;s information to the candidate.

People usually take this very seriously, but occasionally I&#8217;ve referred several people to a company only to find out that the company didn&#8217;t follow up on the introduction. That&#8217;s pretty much the last chance that company will get from me. If I made a special personal effort to send you someone fantastic who&#8217;s really qualified for the job, and you didn&#8217;t contact that candidate, there&#8217;s really no excuse for such rudeness. You&#8217;re telling me you don&#8217;t think my experience and judgment about who&#8217;s good for the job is valid. I won&#8217;t offer it again, then.

Recruiters are an interesting lot. They have a bad reputation, and I think that&#8217;s because a few aggressive, pushy people poison the well for the rest of the recruiters. Most recruiters are really good people doing a hard and extremely valuable job, with a lot of care and personal attention to their client as well as their candidates. If you&#8217;ve ever built a team, you know how hard it can be. Many recruiters are used to being treated very badly because of their profession&#8217;s reputation. I try to make up for that by being extra nice to them. Recruiters who contact me by email often get a personal call in return, and always a personal email reply with a thank you. In almost all cases, recruiters will tell me who their client is after I&#8217;ve introduced myself. I only refer my friends to recruiters when I know who they&#8217;re recruiting for, and I never make an end run around recruiters. They are doing a mostly thankless job, and they should not be cheated out of their commission.

Over the years I&#8217;ve been lucky enough to help a half dozen friends find jobs, and there&#8217;s pretty much no better feeling. If you&#8217;re looking, let me know. I know really good people who are looking for you. I&#8217;m never too busy to help make introductions.
