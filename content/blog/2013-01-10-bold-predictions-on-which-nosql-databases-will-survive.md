In case you&#8217;ve been [living under a rock][1] for the last 5 years, the NoSQL movement has changed. There was a time when everyone &#8212; EVERYONE &#8212; was dumping on relational databases, and MySQL in particular. Nonsense like &#8220;SQL itself is inherently unscalable&#8221; routinely came out of the mouths of otherwise usually sensible people. But that&#8217;s cooled off a little bit, thank heavens.

And what&#8217;s the new hotness? Well, Big Data, of course! But I digress. In the world of databases, it&#8217;s move over NoSQL, heeeeeere&#8217;s NewSQL. I&#8217;m talkin&#8217; NuoDB, Clustrix, MySQL Cluster (NDB), and so forth. A lot of people now recognize that it wasn&#8217;t SQL or the relational model that was a problem &#8212; it was the implementations that had some issues. The pendulum has swung a little away from vilifying SQL, and we don&#8217;t talk about NoSQL as much as we talk about document-oriented or key-value or whatever.

Does that spell death for NoSQL databases? Not in my opinion. But I am just in the mood to stick my neck out a bit today, so I&#8217;m going to do something I don&#8217;t normally do &#8212; predict the future. Here&#8217;s my prediction: **there may be many NoSQL databases that live long and healthy lives, but among them will probably be MongoDB, Redis, and Riak**.

Discuss!

PS: this prediction is about what I think will happen. If I get one out of three right, I&#8217;ll be happy. It&#8217;s not an endorsement of any database, dismissal of any other database, or an opinion about what I think *should* happen. Limitations and exclusions apply.
