If you follow what Percona is up to, you might have noticed that I've created a set of high-quality monitoring and graphing plugins for MySQL and related systems. Currently they support Nagios and Cacti. I'll give a [free webinar on March 28th][1] discussing these, and more broadly, discussing how to monitor MySQL successfully to avoid common problems like spammy alerts about nonexistent problems.

> [VividCortex](https://vividcortex.com/) is the startup I founded in 2012. It's the easiest way to monitor what
> your servers are doing in production and I consider it far superior to Cacti. VividCortex offers [MySQL performance
> monitoring](https://vividcortex.com/monitoring/mysql/) and [PostgreSQL
> performance management](https://vividcortex.com/monitoring/postgres/) among many
> other features.
