Want a free copy of [High Performance MySQL, Third Edition][1]? If you [register][2] before the early-bird pricing expires for the [MySQL Conference in April][3], and use the discount code PL-Book, you'll get to take a free copy home from the conference!

> [VividCortex](https://vividcortex.com/) is the startup I founded in 2012. It's the easiest way to monitor what
> your servers are doing in production. It does TCP network
> traffic analysis. VividCortex offers [MySQL performance
> monitoring](https://vividcortex.com/monitoring/mysql/) and [PostgreSQL
> performance management](https://vividcortex.com/monitoring/postgres/) among many
> other features.


And now, a status update: I'm currently proofing the QC2 (quality control #2) revision of the book; after this, the book goes to manufacturing. The PDF is now 820 pages, which is a lot of work to proofread. You can imagine how much more in-depth we've been able to go with so many more pages.

The [free sample][4] online is Chapter 8, on optimizing MySQL configuration. Liz van Dijk just [tweeted][5] this about it:

> The sample chapter of High Perf MySQL 3rd Ed is both amazingly to the point and hilarious at times. Instant buy for me.

If you haven't yet, I encourage you to take a look at the sample. Then go register for the conference to get your free copy, and I'll see you in Santa Clara! We're also arranging a book-signing at the conference, so you can get some scribbles on your copy if you want!
