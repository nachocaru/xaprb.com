You have only a few more days to sign up for the [MySQL Conference and Expo][1] before the early-bird discount goes away. Check out the schedule of speakers and tutorials, and sign up soon! And just in case you didn't get one from any of the other people blogging about it, you can email me for a code that's good for a 20% discount.

[I'm presenting two sessions: one on the query cache, and one on EXPLAIN][2]. Both are manageable for an hour-or-so talk. I'm not trying to boil the ocean, but rather to help you understand these important topics in ways you'll remember after leaving the conference.

I was also on the voting committee for the proposals, so I've read them all. I really believe this event is worth every penny. (Of course, as a speaker, it doesn't cost me&#8230; but I digress).

While you're there you should also plan to get certified, also at a significant savings. This is a great career move, and there are sessions that will help you prepare. There's a critical shortage of people who really know how to use MySQL. I must admit, I'm not even certified! But I'll be taking the certification exams too.
