So far this year I've been totally silent about the [MySQL Conference and Expo 2009][1]. In the past I've been a vocal advocate of [going to the conference][2] and [sending your employees to the conference][3]. So my silence was conspicuous to me, if not to you. I've always considered myself a strong MySQL supporter and I still do.

Why wasn't I telling people to go to this year's conference? Simple: I can't in good conscience tell people to attend an event from which I've been excluded ([oh, the irony][4]). So I stayed quiet while [MySQL employees][5] [told people][6] to [read my article][7] about [how to get a session accepted to the MySQL conference][8]. More irony. It is not my way to remain silent, but circumstances demanded it.

But now I'm back! My colleagues and I will be there, and now I'm advocating for your attendance there, as ever. You should come to the conference, and you should consider attending the [Percona Performance Conference][9] at the same time so you can learn about more than just MySQL (and see the "missing sessions" that weren't accepted).

And for the record, I never pressured anyone to accept my sessions. I just stayed silent. That's what polite people do when they're not on the guest list: they just find another party.
