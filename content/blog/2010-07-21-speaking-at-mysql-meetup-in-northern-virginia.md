The closest thing I know of to a &#8220;Northern Virginia MySQL Meetup&#8221; is the [Sterling Database Data Solutions Group][1]. I got in touch with the organizer and [we scheduled a meeting next Wednesday July 28th][2]. I&#8217;ll be presenting, and so will someone from Fusion-IO, a solid-state storage vendor. This is on short notice, so tell your friends about it! It would be great to grow a strong monthly meetup presence in this area.

Here&#8217;s the abstract I sent: &#8220;This talk covers best practices to help you get the most out of MySQL performance. It assumes you know a database well, though it need not be MySQL. We&#8217;ll cover several angles of the topic. Configuration is usually the first thing people ask about. Although it&#8217;s possible to misconfigure MySQL and get bad performance, the configuration options you need for good performance are few and rather simple. We&#8217;ll see how to inspect MySQL&#8217;s performance and status, also a fairly simple subject. Next is query tuning. There are a few surprises in MySQL due to its simpler query execution engine than Oracle or SQL Server. We&#8217;ll see how to avoid those surprises and work with the query optimizer. Finally, we&#8217;ll focus on what you should know if you are considering migrating part or all of your application from Oracle. There will be plenty of time for questions, so bring yours!&#8221;
