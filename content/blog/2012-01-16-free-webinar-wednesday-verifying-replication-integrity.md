Join me Wednesday for a free webinar on using the new [Percona Toolkit v2.0.3 to verify replication integrity][1]. If you&#8217;re not familiar with this topic, it&#8217;s one of those must-do things that no one officially tells you is necessary with MySQL. The new tools in Percona Toolkit 2.0.3 make it much easier and less complicated &#8212; and safer &#8212; than before. Well worth an hour of your time.
