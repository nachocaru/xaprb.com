I&#8217;m going to be at [beCamp 2008][1], the followup to the first beCamp, which I sadly missed.

beCamp is a BarCamp un-conference. Tonight was about meeting, greeting, and throwing ideas at the wall to see which ones stick. Literally. We stuck pieces of paper on the wall with our ideas &#8212; things we can either talk about or want to hear about &#8212; and then scratched our votes on them to see which are popular.

I live and breathe MySQL for a decent part of the day, so I hesitated, but then stuck &#8220;MySQL Performance&#8221; on the wall. It got quite a few votes, so I assume will be giving a talk on MySQL performance basics at some point during the conference. (The exact schedule is probably being determined right now, in my absence, but I&#8217;m so tired right now that I&#8217;ll just take my chances on it not being at 8:00 AM tomorrow.) [edit: I just checked the website and there won't be anything before 9:00, and the schedule is determined tomorrow. I did say I'm tired, right?]

See you there!

PS: if you want to meet some of my colleagues from my former employer, the [Rimm-Kaufman Group][2], they&#8217;ll be there too, wearing the &#8220;We&#8217;re Hiring&#8221; t-shirts. [They&#8217;re hiring][3], by the way.
