Wow. Now&#8217;s not a good day to announce anything true on your blog. I see a bunch of stuff that probably is true &#8212; but who&#8217;s banking on that? Is there really a new version of HeidiSQL? Is Arjen really moving to California to do MySQL work? Is Tokutek really purchasing Oracle? Gee, I&#8217;m not sure.

If I had any thoughts left in my head, I&#8217;d [make a funny][1] myself, but my head&#8217;s pretty empty. Believe that if you want to.
