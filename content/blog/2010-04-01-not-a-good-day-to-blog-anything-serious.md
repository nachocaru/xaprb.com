Wow. Now's not a good day to announce anything true on your blog. I see a bunch of stuff that probably is true &#8212; but who's banking on that? Is there really a new version of HeidiSQL? Is Arjen really moving to California to do MySQL work? Is Tokutek really purchasing Oracle? Gee, I'm not sure.
