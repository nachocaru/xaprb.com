PHP has no built-in debugger.

This is HUGE. The ability to say `perl -d ....` and have a fully featured, gdb-like debugger at your command, with absolutely nothing to download or install, is HUGE.

Debugging PHP is an epic pain in the best of circumstances, and it&#8217;s all but impossible on a system you don&#8217;t control and can&#8217;t waste a bunch of time on even if you had permission to install things.

If I&#8217;m wrong, please correct me!
