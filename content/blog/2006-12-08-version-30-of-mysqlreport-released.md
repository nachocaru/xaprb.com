Daniel Nichter has released version 3.0 of [mysqlreport][1], one of my favorite tools for quickly comprehending the overall state of a MySQL server. The new version prints out the most important information about InnoDB.

It looks like this:

<pre>$ perl mysqlreport --innodb-only

As always, very helpful&#8230; just the facts, nothing more. I have 1.25 GB of buffer pool, 100% used, very small percentage of dirty pages, etc etc. You can see it all at a glance.

It pulls the data from `SHOW STATUS`, which means it only works on newer versions of MySQL. Those variables are available in 5.0.3 and later, if memory serves me.
