I&#8217;d like to encourage everyone in the Postgres world to submit session proposals to the [2011 O&#8217;Reilly MySQL conference][1]. It&#8217;ll be a different event this year. We&#8217;re looking for a breadth as well as a depth of proposals on technologies beyond MySQL, and in the speaker selection committee conference calls, PostgreSQL was on the top of the list. I am on the committee. Your high-quality submissions will get a fair and unbiased vote from me, and I think I can speak for the rest of the committee too. There are no ideologues this year. Postgres is a great open-source database that deserves to be heard in this audience, where it&#8217;s been absent the last couple of years. This is a great conference for Postgres to have a significant showing.
