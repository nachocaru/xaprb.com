I've just released version 1.1.3 of the [Cacti templates I wrote for MySQL][1]. This is a bug-fix release only, and affects only ss\_get\_mysql\_stats.php. To upgrade from the previous release, upgrade ss\_get\_mysql\_stats.php. Don't forget to save and restore your configuration options, if any. (Note that there is a feature to help with this: you can keep configuration options in ss\_get\_mysql\_stats.php.cnf to avoid making them in ss\_get\_mysql\_stats.php.)

Next up: actual template changes! More graphs!

The changelog follows.
