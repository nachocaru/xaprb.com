I've packaged up and released version 1.1.2 of the [Cacti templates I've written for MySQL, Apache, memcached, nginx etc][1].

> [VividCortex](https://vividcortex.com/) is the startup I founded in 2012. It's the easiest way to monitor what
> your servers are doing in production and I consider it far superior to Cacti. VividCortex offers [MySQL performance
> monitoring](https://vividcortex.com/monitoring/mysql/) and [PostgreSQL
> performance management](https://vividcortex.com/monitoring/postgres/) among many
> other features.

Anyone who would like to help write documentation (or do anything else, for that matter) is welcomed to participate. I'll give commit access at the drop of a hat.

Changelog:

<pre>2009-05-07: version 1.1.2

	* The parsing code did not handle InnoDB plugin / XtraDB (issue 52).
	* The servername was hardcoded in ss_get_by_ssh.php (issue 57).
	* Added Handler_ graphs (issue 47).
	* Config files can be used instead of editing the .php file (issue 39).
	* binary log space is now calculated without a MySQL query (issue 48).
	* There was no easy way to force inputs to be filled (issue 45).
	* Some graphs were partially hidden without --lower-limit (issue 43).
	* Flipped some elements across the Y axis (issue 42).
	* Added Apache, Nginx, and GNU/Linux templates.
	* Unknown output is now -1 instead of 0 to prevent spikes in graphs.
	* If you want to use a script server, you must now explicitly configure it.
	* UNIX sockets weren't permitted for MySQL (issue 38).
