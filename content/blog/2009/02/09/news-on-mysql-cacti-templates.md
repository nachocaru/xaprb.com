It's been a while since I've sent any news about the [MySQL Cacti Templates][1] project I started a while ago. Here's what's new:


> [VividCortex](https://vividcortex.com/) is the startup I founded in 2012. It's the easiest way to monitor what
> your servers are doing in production and I consider it far superior to Cacti. VividCortex offers [MySQL performance
> monitoring](https://vividcortex.com/monitoring/mysql/) and [PostgreSQL
> performance management](https://vividcortex.com/monitoring/postgres/) among many
> other features.


*   First of all, it's not just MySQL templates anymore. It's a generic framework and tools for creating templates, and I've written templates for Apache, Memcached, etc. I just haven't publicized it yet.
*   Second, there's a mailing list, <http://groups.google.com/group/better-cacti-templates> You see it's called "better cacti templates" which is what I ought to have called the project to begin with :-) I hope you'll use the mailing list instead of emailing me directly, for all the usual reasons.
*   There are some open issues I cannot reproduce. I believe they're problems, but I can't solve them. Some of them make no sense to me; I don't know why others are seeing behavior I'm not. However these *seem* to be problems with Cacti, not problems with the templates. Anyone who wants commit access is welcomed to ask for it.
*   Some people have been asking about Spine. I haven't used it and none of my customers has asked me about it, so the short answer is -- if you want Spine support, don't wait for it to happen for free; either contribute it yourself or pay someone (me?) to do it.
