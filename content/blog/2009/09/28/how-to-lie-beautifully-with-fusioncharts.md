Gotta love those three-dimensional charts. They sure are shiny! Look at this:

<div id="attachment_1311" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 474px">
  <img src="http://www.xaprb.com/media/2009/09/graphs.png" alt="FusionCharts graphs" title="FusionCharts graphs" width="464" height="195" class="size-full wp-image-1311" /><p class="wp-caption-text">
    FusionCharts graphs
  </p>
</div>

This is a screenshot of [FusionCharts graphs][1]. But wait, on closer inspection: 5 and 7 are the same height? 6 is exactly twice as tall as 2?

Pseudo-three-dimensional charts are the bane of my existence. [Tufte][2] would definitely not approve. (If you don't have [The Visual Display of Quantitative Information][2], you should really get it and give it a read.)
