I'm looking for a freelancer to convert this WordPress blog into Markdown for use with Octopress. It should be straightforward &#8212; I have already used a plugin to export the data as Markdown. However, a few extra things will need to be taken care of. I have posted this job on [Elance][1]. Please submit proposals there!
