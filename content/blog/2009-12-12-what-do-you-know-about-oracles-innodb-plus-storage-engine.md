That&#8217;s right, I said InnoDB+, with a &#8220;plus&#8221; at the end. I didn&#8217;t know it existed until, while following some links from [Monty&#8217;s appeal to save MySQL][1], I decided to read a [Groklaw post][2] that links to [Eben Moglen&#8217;s letter to the EU Commission][3], which includes this text:

> Innobase could therefore have provided an enhanced version of InnoDB, like Oracle&#8217;s current InnoDB+, under non-GPL license, &#8230;

I don&#8217;t know anything more. Do you?
