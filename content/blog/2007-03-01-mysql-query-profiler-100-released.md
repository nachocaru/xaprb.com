I've updated MySQL Query Profiler, which I consider the most important tool I've written. It's now included as part of the MySQL Toolkit project on Sourceforge.

The updates are mainly small bug fixes, and I reviewed the documentation as well. Since I've been using it for a while and didn't change much, I have decided to release it as version 1.0.0.

At some point I may extend it to address the new storage engines being developed for MySQL 5.1 right now.
