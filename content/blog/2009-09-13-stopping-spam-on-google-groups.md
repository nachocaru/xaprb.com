Spammers seem to have gotten smarter recently, and able to post garbage to Google Groups. There was some spam on a couple of the groups I&#8217;ve created, and members helped me find a way to stop it. I&#8217;m glad they did, because since then it&#8217;s stopped an increasing flow of spam. I just deleted and banned a whole bunch of emails titled &#8220;answer group&#8221; across different groups, and I see the same crud got through to a group I&#8217;m on but don&#8217;t own.

Here&#8217;s the recipe:

*   Moderate messages from new members.

That&#8217;s all. Then you can log in and delete emails from spammers, and ban them, so that at least only you, and not the whole group, gets spammed.
