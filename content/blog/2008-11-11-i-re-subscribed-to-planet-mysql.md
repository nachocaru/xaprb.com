I have calmed down after my [frustration of a few days ago][1].Â  My conscience says I was being unfair to Sun's employees, who are just trying to make a business succeed in difficult times, and who support OpenSQL Camp, Maatkit, MySQL, and many other things that are dear to me.Â  To those I treated harshly, I'm sorry. Just like email, blog posts are easy to publish and impossible to take back.Â  I'll try harder to keep that in mind in the future.
