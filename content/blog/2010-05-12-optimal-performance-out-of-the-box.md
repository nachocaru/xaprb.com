Most database companies would be proud to say that their products perform optimally out of the box. It means they accomplished a Herculean feat of engineering. But most databases have configuration options because this is almost impossible. For example, MySQL has scores of tuning options, and it needs a lot more.

So when someone benchmarks your database and makes you look bad, usually you can say &#8220;that benchmark was run by someone who doesn&#8217;t know how to properly tune my database software.&#8221;

But what if the benchmarker claims that [your database didn&#8217;t **need** to be tuned][1], (via [Dave Page][2]), because it&#8217;s optimal out of the box? Do you accept the benchmark results, or reject the compliment?
