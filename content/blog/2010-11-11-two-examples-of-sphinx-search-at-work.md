[Sphinx][1] is an amazing piece of software. Andrew Aksyonoff is an amazing guy, too. But aside from Andrew&#8217;s many talents, and Sphinx&#8217;s awesomeness, I wanted to list two related examples of how Sphinx makes the world a better place. Both examples are implemented as open-source software from [Ivinco][2], a company founded by a group of people I used to work with.

The first is the Sphinx WordPress search plugin. I have repeatedly considered using it on my own blog, but I&#8217;m running on Pair&#8217;s shared hosting, so I don&#8217;t think I should do that. But we use it on the MySQL Performance Blog. It returns highly relevant and very fast search results, and has a number of other benefits that end up being very good for SEO, among other things.

The second is the Dokuwiki search plugin. I love Dokuwiki, but its built-in search is horrible; the results are anything but relevant. The Sphinx search plugin is excellent. So if you hate Dokuwiki&#8217;s search results, try this plugin and see what you think.

Both the WordPress plugin and the Dokuwiki plugin are available from [Ivinco&#8217;s open-source software page][3].
