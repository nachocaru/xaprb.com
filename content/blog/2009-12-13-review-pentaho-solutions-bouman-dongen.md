[Pentaho Solutions][1], Business Intelligence and Data Warehousing with Pentaho and MySQL. By Roland Bouman and Jos van Dongen, Wiley 2009. Page count: about 570 pages. (Here&#8217;s [a link to the publisher&#8217;s site][2].)

The book is big in part because it&#8217;s about a GUI tool, so there are the requisite number of screenshots (but not too many). It is structured into four parts, each on a different topic.

The first part is 4 chapters on getting started with [Pentaho][3]: from a quick-start through installing, configuring, and understanding the Pentaho BI Stack. Pentaho is a complex suite of tools, and there&#8217;s a handy architecture diagram to help you grok what the parts are and how they fit together. You&#8217;ll learn about topics such as Mondrian and configuring the database connection pool.

The second part is a primer on dimensional modeling and DW design. It uses a sample database that the authors developed for the book, which you can download from the publisher&#8217;s website. You&#8217;ll learn about star schemas and data marts. You can skip this part if you&#8217;re familiar with BI concepts in general, and just want to learn how Pentaho implements them.

Part three is about Pentaho data integration. The first chapter is a primer on integration, which again you&#8217;ll be able to skip if you know your stuff. Then you&#8217;ll walk through topics such as generating dimensions, designing, and deploying data integration solutions with Kettle and Spoon.

Part four is about designing and building BI applications with Pentaho: learning about its metadata layer; using the reporting tools; scheduling, subscriptions, and bursting; OLAP; data mining; and building dashboards. This is about half the book, really. There&#8217;s a lot to it &#8212; it&#8217;s all about how to take a generic and flexible suite of tools and get something specific and useful out of it. If you&#8217;ve ever done that, you&#8217;ll know why this could occupy half a book. This isn&#8217;t a simple suite of tools that only does one thing well.

In the end, this is a good beginner-to-intermediate book for people who want to learn about data warehousing, business intelligence, Pentaho, or all of the above. If you don&#8217;t know anything about these topics, you&#8217;ll find the entire book quite useful. If you know a lot about BI and DW, you&#8217;ll probably get the most out of the Pentaho-specific bits. On the other hand, people who already have an advanced level of proficiency with Pentaho will probably know much of what&#8217;s in this book. Those seeking to build advanced solutions presumably also know a lot about the general BI concepts, too. So this is probably not the book for you if you already know what you&#8217;re doing with Pentaho.

Proprietary BI systems cost at least an arm and a leg, and possibly more. That&#8217;s why open-source BI is such a hot topic. If you&#8217;re looking to get acquainted with Pentaho, I think this is an excellent book &#8212; that&#8217;s what I got it for, and I wasn&#8217;t disappointed. Now if only I could find a similar book for [Jaspersoft][4].
