For me, next week&#8217;s Percona Live is a lot like other events: I know I will be busy meeting and greeting and helping unpack boxes and so forth, but I&#8217;ll also be talking and attending other talks. With [five concurrent tracks][1], it&#8217;s tough to decide. This is roughly the equivalent of the MySQL conference every year, which has more tracks, but historically it&#8217;s been easy to cross off some talks as sales pitches. Not so with this event! Here&#8217;s what I want to see the most:

*   [Clustrix&#8217;s keynote][2]. I&#8217;ve watched the progress of our tests with Clustrix very closely. If you&#8217;re coming to the conference, don&#8217;t oversleep.
*   Henrik&#8217;s [session][3] on high availability technologies.
*   Johan&#8217;s [session][4] on NDB performance.
*   Fred&#8217;s talk on [Spider][5].
*   Shlomi&#8217;s talk about [SQL coding][6]. Shlomi&#8217;s talks kind of remind me of the things Beat Vontobel does ([solving a sudoku][7] with a single query, anyone?)
*   And of course, [Domas&#8217;s closing keynote][8].

Perceptive readers will note that I left some slots empty. I haven&#8217;t decided yet. It&#8217;s too hard to choose.

I will be presenting two things next week: a 3-hour [tutorial][9] on how to diagnose problems (part one: method; part two: tools), and a session on [black-box performance analysis][10] and scalability modeling with TCP packet headers.

See you there &#8212; I hope!
