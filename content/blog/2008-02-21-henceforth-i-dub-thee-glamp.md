title: Henceforth, I dub thee GLAMP

  <p>I've decided to start replacing L with GL in acronyms where L supposedly stands for Linux.</p>
  
  <p>I'm not a big user of acronyms, because I think they are exclusionist and they obscure, rather than revealing.  (This wouldn't matter if I wrote for people who already knew what I meant and agreed with me, but that's a waste of time).  However, LAMP is one that I've probably used a few times, without thinking that it is supposed to stand for Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP/Perl/Python.  In fact, it doesn't refer to Linux, it refers to GNU/Linux.  Therefore, it should be <acronym title="GNU/Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP/Perl/Python">GLAMP</acronym>.</p>
  
  <p>Why does this matter? I try not to say Linux, unless I'm referring to a kernel, because <strong>a kernel is not an operating system</strong>.  I try to be pretty careful about <a href="http://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html">saying GNU/Linux when I'm talking about an operating system</a>.  An exception is a recruiting event yesterday at the University of Virginia, where I compromised my principles because of the noise.  Trying to explain myself at that decibel level was just beyond my willingness, so  I said we use Linux.  If the potential recruits hire on with us, they'll get to hear me say GNU/Linux.  And if they don't, maybe they'll attend Richard Stallman's upcoming talk at the engineering school there on March 27th or 28th (sorry, it's not listed online, so I can't link to it).</p>
  
  <p>And you'll see GNU/Linux used conscientiously if you read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/High-Performance-MySQL-Optimization-Replication/dp/0596101716">the book I'm helping to write</a>, too.</p>
  
  <p>GNU matters.  A lot.  You may not think so, but if it ceased to exist, you'd find out.  That applies equally even if you don't think you are a Free Software user.  You have no idea how much you rely on Free Software in your daily life.

I've decided to start replacing L with GL in acronyms where L supposedly stands for Linux.

I'm not a big user of acronyms, because I think they are exclusionist and they obscure, rather than revealing. (This wouldn't matter if I wrote for people who already knew what I meant and agreed with me, but that's a waste of time). However, LAMP is one that I've probably used a few times, without thinking that it is supposed to stand for Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP/Perl/Python. In fact, it doesn't refer to Linux, it refers to GNU/Linux. Therefore, it should be <acronym title="GNU/Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP/Perl/Python">GLAMP</acronym>.

Why does this matter? I try not to say Linux, unless I'm referring to a kernel, because **a kernel is not an operating system**. I try to be pretty careful about [saying GNU/Linux when I'm talking about an operating system][1]. An exception is a recruiting event yesterday at the University of Virginia, where I compromised my principles because of the noise. Trying to explain myself at that decibel level was just beyond my willingness, so I said we use Linux. If the potential recruits hire on with us, they'll get to hear me say GNU/Linux. And if they don't, maybe they'll attend Richard Stallman's upcoming talk at the engineering school there on March 27th or 28th (sorry, it's not listed online, so I can't link to it).

And you'll see GNU/Linux used conscientiously if you read [the book I'm helping to write][2], too.

GNU matters. A lot. You may not think so, but if it ceased to exist, you'd find out. That applies equally even if you don't think you are a Free Software user. You have no idea how much you rely on Free Software in your daily life. And [the GNU project][3] has been and continues to be a keystone in that arch of freedom.

Thanks to [MySQL's Brian Aker for snapping me out of my LAMP carelessness][4].
