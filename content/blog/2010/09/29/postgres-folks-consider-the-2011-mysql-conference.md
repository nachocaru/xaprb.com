I'd like to encourage everyone in the Postgres world to submit session proposals to the [2011 O'Reilly MySQL conference][1]. It'll be a different event this year. We're looking for a breadth as well as a depth of proposals on technologies beyond MySQL, and in the speaker selection committee conference calls, PostgreSQL was on the top of the list. I am on the committee. Your high-quality submissions will get a fair and unbiased vote from me, and I think I can speak for the rest of the committee too. There are no ideologues this year. Postgres is a great open-source database that deserves to be heard in this audience, where it's been absent the last couple of years. This is a great conference for Postgres to have a significant showing.
