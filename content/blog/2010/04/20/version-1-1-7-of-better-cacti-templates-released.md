I've released version 1.1.7 of the [Better Cacti Templates][1] project. This release includes a bunch of bug fixes, some new graphs for MySQL, and two new sets of graphs, for Redis graphing and for JMX graphing.

There are [upgrade instructions][2] on the project wiki for this and all releases. There is also a comprehensive tutorial on [how to create your own graphs and templates][3] with this project. Use the [project issue tracker][4] to view and report issues, and use the [project mailing list][5] to discuss the templates and scripts.

The full changelog follows.

<pre>
  * Added graphs for Innodb_row_lock_waits and Innodb_row_lock_time (issue 118).
  * Added graphs for the MyISAM key buffer memory consumption (issue 127).
  * The loadavg/users graphs failed when only 1 user was logged in (issue 131).
  * The Apache and Nginx graphs couldn't use the --port2 option (issue 129).
  * The InnoDB Log graph's unflushed_log should be GAUGE not COUNTER (issue 10).
  * Added graphs for InnoDB semaphore waits (issue 124).
