[Cary Millsap][1] has a [concise, readable paper on performance][2]. Anyone involved in database performance optimization should read it. Cary's writing has heavily influenced the [mk-query-digest][3] tool for analyzing MySQL/PostgreSQL/Memcached/HTTP query performance, and I think you'll get a lot more from mk-query-digest if you read this paper -- and you should also read his book, [reviewed here][4]. It's one of the top books on my [Essential Books List][5].
