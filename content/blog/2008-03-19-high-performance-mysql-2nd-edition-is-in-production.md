Just a quick note to say we have reached the production stage of the book project. Production is the process of transforming our OpenOffice.org files into the final page layout using a professional typesetting program.

As you can probably guess, this is later than we would have wished. This also means we won't have the book for sale at the upcoming [MySQL Conference and Expo][1]. We will have a display copy at the O'Reilly booth at the conference, and **you will be able to pre-order the book at a discount at that booth**. (Several details remain to be worked out &#8212; do not trust the Amazon.com information on the book, as it is a weird blend of the first and second editions).

The book is very, very good. You will not be disappointed. I can't think of a credible way to explain how good this book is &#8212; it's just very, very good. Better than anything else you've ever read on the subject. So good that you will not want to share, because you'll want to have your own copy handy for frequent reference (I currently refer to the OpenOffice.org files several times a week myself, and I wrote them!). But I'll let you see for yourself. Buy a copy for yourself, your boss, your coworkers, and your mom. And your cat.
