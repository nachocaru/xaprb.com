In the last six months, things have gotten much busier in the world of MySQL performance. That is, making MySQL and InnoDB scale faster out of the box. This is a great trend and I hope it keeps going. At this point I&#8217;m fighting to find enough time to read about what people are doing; I can&#8217;t keep up fast enough to actually understand the improvements. That&#8217;s also good.

The blogs that are posting the most news and analysis are [MySQL Performance Blog][1], [Mikael Ronstrom&#8217;s blog][2], [DimitriK&#8217;s blog][3], and [Mark Callaghan&#8217;s blog][4].
