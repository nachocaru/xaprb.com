Sun has invited me to showcase [Maatkit][1] at the dot-org pavilion at the upcoming [MySQL Conference and Expo 2009][2]. At this time it's really hard to say what I'll be demoing! Development on Maatkit is accelerating and I don't look for that to change, so who knows what we'll have done by then. I'll see you there.
