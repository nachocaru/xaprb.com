Sun has invited me to showcase [Maatkit][1] at the dot-org pavilion at the upcoming [MySQL Conference and Expo 2009][2]. At this time it&#8217;s really hard to say what I&#8217;ll be demoing! Development on Maatkit is accelerating and I don&#8217;t look for that to change, so who knows what we&#8217;ll have done by then. I&#8217;ll see you there.
