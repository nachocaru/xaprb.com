I've created a Central Virginia MySQL Meetup group for those of you in the area. Our [first event][1] will be in a couple of weeks at [Meddius's][2] headquarters. I'd like to meet and get to know more people in this area who use MySQL, so come out and we'll have a good time together! Oh, and beer. And pizza. Of course.
