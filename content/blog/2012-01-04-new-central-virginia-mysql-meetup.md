I&#8217;ve created a Central Virginia MySQL Meetup group for those of you in the area. Our [first event][1] will be in a couple of weeks at [Meddius&#8217;s][2] headquarters. I&#8217;d like to meet and get to know more people in this area who use MySQL, so come out and we&#8217;ll have a good time together! Oh, and beer. And pizza. Of course.
