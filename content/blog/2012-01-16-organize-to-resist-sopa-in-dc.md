If you're in the DC area, there's an emergency meeting of the DC Tech Meetup to get involved in [advocating against SOPA and PIPA][1] legislation.

If you can't make it in person, you can [use the EFF's online form to write your representatives about SOPA and PIPA][2].

Don't wait until it's too late. The Internet is a vital part of our freedom. Well-intentioned legislators could damage that greatly while trying to solve problems they don't understand fully.
