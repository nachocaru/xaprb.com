I've released version 1.1.8 of the [Better Cacti Templates][1] project. This release includes a bunch of bug fixes and several important new graphs. There are [graphs][2] for the new [response-time statistics exposed in Percona Server][3], and a new set of graphs for [MongoDB][4].

There are [upgrade instructions][5] on the project wiki for this and all releases. There is also a comprehensive tutorial on [how to create your own graphs and templates][6] with this project. Use the [project issue tracker][7] (**not the comments on this post!**) to view and report issues, and use the [project mailing list][8] to discuss the templates and scripts.

The full changelog follows.
