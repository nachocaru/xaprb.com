I need help. I'm giving an Ignite talk at [Velocity
EU](http://velocityconf.com/velocityeu2014/) that involves a guitar. I
don't want to bring a guitar all the way from America just for this. Would you
please loan me one?

It doesn't need to be anything special -- any old classical or acoustic 6-string
standard guitar will do. All I'm going to do is tune it.  
If you can bring a guitar to loan me, please post in the comments or give me a
shout on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/xaprb).

Thank you in advance!
