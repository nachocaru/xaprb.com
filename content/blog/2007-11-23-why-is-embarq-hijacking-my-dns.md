<p>Isn't this the same thing that happened a few years ago with ICANN or Verisign or one of those big names?  (strangely, I can't find relevant search results about this!).</p>

<p>I clicked on my toolbar shortcut for <a href="http://www.toggl.com/">Toggl</a> and my Embarq DSL service redirected me to a search-results page instead of telling my browser the truth.  This makes me <em>mad</em>.  The core layers of the Internet are designed the way they are <strong>for a reason</strong> and I don't want to "opt out" of a stupid DNS hijacking stunt I never opted into.</p>

<p>Here's a screenshot of what happens when I type in any old non-existent (or, in Toggl's case, timing-out) domain name.</p>

<p>And here's what happens when I do a DNS lookup:</p>

<pre>baron@kanga:~$ dig www.toggl.com

<p>Did I mention that this makes me mad?  Time to get on the phone.</p>

<p>PS: it looks like <a href="http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news04/2007/11/verizon_search.html">Verizon</a> is doing it too.</p>
