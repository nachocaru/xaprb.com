In preparation for the book&#8217;s launch next month, I&#8217;ve created a website for it: [High Performance MySQL][1]. You may notice that the URL isn&#8217;t the same as the site for the first edition. It proved to be difficult to transfer that domain. If we accomplish it later on, I&#8217;ll set up a redirect.

Why an official site? To give you free stuff, of course. Final drafts of the front matter (TOC, preface, foreword), a sample chapter, and the index are there already. When the final quality control is done, I&#8217;ll update these. Right now they don&#8217;t have professionally drawn figures. That will change soon.

Also, you&#8217;ll eventually various things such as <del datetime="2008-05-30T20:45:48+00:00">errata</del>* and book-related info that I feel belongs there instead of here. You can subscribe to the site&#8217;s RSS feed to find out when these planned additions become reality.

* Surely there will be no errata, right? Right?
