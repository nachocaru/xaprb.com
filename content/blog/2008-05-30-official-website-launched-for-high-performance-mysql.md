In preparation for the book's launch next month, I've created a website for it: [High Performance MySQL][1]. You may notice that the URL isn't the same as the site for the first edition. It proved to be difficult to transfer that domain. If we accomplish it later on, I'll set up a redirect.

Why an official site? To give you free stuff, of course. Final drafts of the front matter (TOC, preface, foreword), a sample chapter, and the index are there already. When the final quality control is done, I'll update these. Right now they don't have professionally drawn figures. That will change soon.

Also, you'll eventually various things such as <del datetime="2008-05-30T20:45:48+00:00">errata</del>* and book-related info that I feel belongs there instead of here. You can subscribe to the site's RSS feed to find out when these planned additions become reality.

* Surely there will be no errata, right? Right?
