I'll be presenting several sessions at the [O'Reilly MySQL Conference & Expo 2011][1], which is April 11-14 in Santa Clara, California. I recommend this conference to anyone interested in open-source databases including MySQL, PostgreSQL, CouchDB, MongoDB, and others. There is very good coverage of a diverse list of open-source databases.

My sessions are as follows:

*   [Building on Strengths, Learning from Differences][2]: a keynote address on the open-source database ecosystem, how we got here, and what we can do to make the most of the future.
*   [Forecasting MySQL Performance and Scalability][3]: mathematical models for forecasting performance and scalability that actually work and are not hard to do. ([Example][4])
*   [The Aspersa System Administrator's Toolkit][5]: this is an under-appreciated toolkit at the moment, but it could be the next Maatkit.

In addition, I am listed as presenting [Diagnosing and Fixing MySQL Performance Problems][6], a 3-hour tutorial on how to find and solve performance problems with swift and definite results. However, I actually have a scheduling conflict and a couple of my colleagues will present this instead.
