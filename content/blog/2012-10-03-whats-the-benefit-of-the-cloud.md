Given that [most people don't know what the cloud is][1], I guess we shouldn't be surprised that most people can't articulate the benefits of cloud computing clearly. I commonly hear "Scalability!" "Easy provisioning!" "Flexibility!" and so on. Of course, all of these are benefits you can get without the cloud. [Theo][2] says it pretty well, so I won't belabor that point.

What do you think are the benefits of cloud computing?

In the end I can think of only one really unique benefit, and it's indirect. It is this: the rise of cloud computing is creating a social phenomenon among engineers. The benefit isn't the technology, or the economics, or any of that stuff. It's *the change in people's mindset* towards thinking at a higher level of abstraction. For example, thinking about resources instead of machines, and APIs instead of programs.
