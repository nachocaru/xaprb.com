Given that [most people don&#8217;t know what the cloud is][1], I guess we shouldn&#8217;t be surprised that most people can&#8217;t articulate the benefits of cloud computing clearly. I commonly hear &#8220;Scalability!&#8221; &#8220;Easy provisioning!&#8221; &#8220;Flexibility!&#8221; and so on. Of course, all of these are benefits you can get without the cloud. [Theo][2] says it pretty well, so I won&#8217;t belabor that point.

What do you think are the benefits of cloud computing?

In the end I can think of only one really unique benefit, and it&#8217;s indirect. It is this: the rise of cloud computing is creating a social phenomenon among engineers. The benefit isn&#8217;t the technology, or the economics, or any of that stuff. It&#8217;s *the change in people&#8217;s mindset* towards thinking at a higher level of abstraction. For example, thinking about resources instead of machines, and APIs instead of programs.
