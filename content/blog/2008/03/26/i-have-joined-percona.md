Effective April 1, I will join [Percona][1] full-time as a consultant. I'll be helping people build high-performance applications with MySQL, but I'll also be continuing to develop and improve tools such as [Maatkit][2].

This career change has been a long time in progress. I'm really looking forward to it, but at the same time it's hard to leave my current employer, [The Rimm-Kaufman Group (RKG)][3]. Working with them has been the best job I've ever had. But ultimately, my dream job is to help as many people as I can, and consulting will be a better way to do that.

At a time like this, I like to reflect on the trail that has led here. It's a good opportunity to realize how fortunate I really am and fill up my gratitude tank. So I'd like to thank everyone who has helped me reach this point. All the people who have encouraged me, sponsored me, suggested new options... all kinds of help. A special thanks to my wife Lynn, to Alan Rimm-Kaufman and all my colleagues at RKG, to the many fine people at MySQL, and to the MySQL community as a whole. My deep gratitude to all of you. I look forward to working with you even more in the future.
