Today [High Performance MySQL, Second Edition][1] went to press. I&#8217;ve been working with the production team over the last couple of weeks, proofreading and checking the index and working with the artist who re-drew the illustrations.

I spoke to the production editor this morning and she told me the schedule is for the bound-book date to be the 16th of June. The official in-stock date is June 19th. I don&#8217;t know how many copies they&#8217;re printing for the first printing. But I think there have been a lot of pre-orders (rumors I&#8217;ve heard from my Amazon Affiliate account).
I cannot wait to hold my copy in my hands!
