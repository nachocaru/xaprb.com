I&#8217;ve bought my plane tickets for [OpenSQL Camp US 2009][1], in Portland, Oregon on the weekend of November 14th. I&#8217;m really looking forward to the event and seeing friends again. And I&#8217;m psyched that the third incarnation of this event is taking place! I wish I could have been at the 2nd one too, earlier this year in Europe.
