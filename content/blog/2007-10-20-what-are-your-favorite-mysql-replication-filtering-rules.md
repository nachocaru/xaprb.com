title: What are your favorite MySQL replication filtering rules?
  <p>As I wrote a few days ago, I'm writing the <a href="http://www.xaprb.com/blog/2007/10/18/high-performance-mysql-second-edition-replication-scaling-and-high-availability/">replication chapter for the second edition of High Performance MySQL</a>.  I'm writing about replication filtering rules right now, and I thought it would be good to get input on this.  If you have favorite replication filtering tricks you'd like to share, or tasks that always frustrate and/or confuse you, please post them in the comments.  I'm making a section that shows how to accomplish common filtering and rewriting needs, such as preventing <code>GRANT</code> statements from replicating to the slaves.</p>
  
  <p>Thanks very much!  I hope the community involvement will make this book more useful for everyone.</p>

As I wrote a few days ago, I'm writing the [replication chapter for the second edition of High Performance MySQL][1]. I'm writing about replication filtering rules right now, and I thought it would be good to get input on this. If you have favorite replication filtering tricks you'd like to share, or tasks that always frustrate and/or confuse you, please post them in the comments. I'm making a section that shows how to accomplish common filtering and rewriting needs, such as preventing `GRANT` statements from replicating to the slaves.

Thanks very much! I hope the community involvement will make this book more useful for everyone.
