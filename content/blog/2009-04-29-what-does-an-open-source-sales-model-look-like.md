At the MySQL conference, a person who used to hold an important position in an important sales organization told us something like the following: &#8220;You know, you guys at Percona are great, but you have a big problem. You don&#8217;t have any $500,000 customers who only file one support incident per year. Those customers are where you can really make big money.&#8221;

We were well aware of the investigations this person did into which customers are the most profitable, and we had decided a long time ago that chasing huge sales without delivering matching services is flawed. I told this person as much: &#8220;that model is fundamentally broken because it doesn&#8217;t align cost with value delivered.&#8221;

Actually, we do have customers who rank in the top 50 of the Fortune 500. I&#8217;m thinking of one right now. They filed only one case so far. And they&#8217;ve paid us for exactly the amount of hours we spent on that case. And far from being a problem, this is exactly where we&#8217;re doing things right.

Some people may see us as shrinking the pie by billing just a few thousand dollars for &#8220;huge jobs.&#8221; They might think we&#8217;re silly for telling the customer that a few hours on the phone and remotely is going to be better for them than a week onsite. They may consider us small peanuts because we don&#8217;t have 10-million-dollar deals. What they are missing is what the customers see clearly: it&#8217;s good to write win-win contracts and leave something on the table. If it looks like table scraps to Mr. Million Dollar Salesman, that&#8217;s okay. Those bloated &#8220;profitable&#8221; contracts are short-term thinking, and they&#8217;re actually a serious weakness. Don&#8217;t celebrate our &#8220;problem&#8221; too much. Keep an eye in the rearview mirror. Is it a problem, or is it our secret sauce?

One problem I think we might actually have is how to get a good sales person with our model. You see, we don&#8217;t actually have any sales staff at all right now. I am not sure the math would work out the way a traditional sales person would like. But that&#8217;s because a traditional sales person is used to being rewarded for &#8220;earning money for the company,&#8221; which I think is really broken, at least in the way it&#8217;s traditionally implemented.

I&#8217;ve said before that I think one of the reasons [MySQL was unable to create an open-source business model][1] is that their sales folks pushed the company in the direction of closed source. I&#8217;m honestly not sure what the best open-source sales model is. I know that I really feel good about our services delivery model and our pricing model; right now our sales model is nonexistent. We are passive; we just answer inquiries and sign contracts. As things stand now, nobody&#8217;s *doing* any sales.

Still, I think this is a good problem to have, and I trust that the right person will come along and see the opportunity to create a good salary at the same time as really providing a service to Percona and the customers. That person will explain to us how cost (salary) and value (service to us and customers) can be impedance-matched too. And that will probably be an innovation, or at least unconventional. With all the other ways Percona is unconventional, I don&#8217;t expect us to create a conventional sales model either.
