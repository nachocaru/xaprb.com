If you&#8217;re at the MySQL Conference and Expo, you can get a free sample chapter of the upcoming High Performance MySQL Second Edition. Just go to the exhibition area. As you go through the doors, take an immediate left and look for the sample chapter on O&#8217;Reilly&#8217;s table. It&#8217;s a rough draft and contains typos and my incredibly crude drawings instead of those that will go into the final book, but it should serve to give you an idea of the book&#8217;s depth and scope. Kudos to Andy Oram, our editor, who was able to get these done for us on very short notice.
