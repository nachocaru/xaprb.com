In case you [live under a rock][1], the [MySQL conference][2] starts on Tuesday. There are 8 concurrent tracks of content. Aside from [my own][3] talks, here are the sessions I would most like to see.

On Tuesday:

*   Tutorial: [Innodb and XtraDB Architecture and Performance Optimization][4]. Peter's talks are always great, and this is a perennial favorite. If you have never been, you should go to this one. You will realize how little you really know about InnoDB/XtraDB, and how much it matters.
*   Tutorial: [Linux and H/W optimizations for MySQL][5]. Last year I tweeted that Yoshinori's tutorial was the 3rd edition of High Performance MySQL, and I really wasn't exaggerating *that* much.
*   BoF session: [Percona XtraDB Cluster][6]. I believe that this is one of the few truly groundbreaking changes to MySQL -- right up there with "MySQL has transactions now" and "MySQL adds replication."

On Wednesday:

*   [MySQL Plugins &#8211; why should I bother?][7] Sergei is the co-author of a book on plugins. Their power is not to be underestimated.
*   [Getting InnoDB Compression Ready for Facebook Scale][8]. Compression is very powerful -- if we can just get the implementation to work better. Facebook, apparently, has done that.
*   [The 5 minute DBA: MySQL DBA 101 for Non DBA's][9]. Get started fast with Matt Yonkovit's friendly, engaging and relevant talk. Spoiler: it's longer than five minutes.
*   [MySQL Optimizer Standoff MySQL 5.6 and MariaDB 5.3][10]. Peter at it again, this time digging into the advances in newer releases of the server, which make a huge difference on some common and important workloads.
*   [Scaling MySQL Databases for the Web][11]. This is the "Vitess" talk, a technology I'm extremely keen to hear about. It's now powering YouTube's backend.
*   BoF session: [Tungsten User Fest][6]. Tungsten has matured into a very interesting technology in the last couple of years.

On Thursday:

*   [Oracle to MySQL migration][12]. Marco Tusa has actually implemented some of the most impressive migrations in MySQL's history.
*   [Spil Games: Outgrowing an internet startup][13]. This should be a great talk about running MySQL in a busy startup in the real world.
*   Here I'm torn between [MySQL and SSD: usage and tuning][14] and [Common Schema: a framework for MySQL server administration][15]. (I'm always torn between at least 2 or 3 talks, but in this case especially so for some reason.)
*   [Verifying MySQL Replication Safely With pt-table-checksum 2.0][16]. If you aren't verifying that your replicas have the same data as their masters, you need to, and this is the tool to do it.
