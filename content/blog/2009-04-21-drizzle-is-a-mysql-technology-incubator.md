This morning's MySQL Conference keynotes had a number of inaccuracies, but one that I wish to point out is the characterizations of [Drizzle][1]. It looks to me like some Sun/Oracle/MySQL folks are trying to take credit, now that they're seeing it become a resounding success, for the good work of the Drizzle project. It is not a technology incubator, nor is it the "MySQL Drizzle Project." It is a new database server. It is Drizzle.
