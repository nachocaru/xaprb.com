I'm excited to be speaking at the [Percona Live MySQL Conference][1] again this
year. I'll present two sessions: [Developing MySQL Applications with Go][3] and
[Knowing the Unknowable: Per-Query Metrics][3]. The first is a walk-through of
everything I've learned over the last 18 months writing large-scale MySQL-backed
applications with Google's Go language. The second is about using statistical
techniques to find out things you can't even measure, such as how much CPU a
query really causes MySQL to use. There are great reasons that this is both
desirable to know, and impossible to do directly in the server itself.

I'm also looking forward to the conference overall. Take a few minutes and
browse the selection of talks. As usual, it's a fantastic program; the speakers
are really the top experts from the MySQL world. The conference committee and
Percona have done a great job again this year! See you in Santa Clara.
