Thanks to [a comment on a recent blog post][1] where I lamented the lack of an easy-to-use password manager, I&#8217;ve switched from Revelation to&#8230; Vim.

I already use Vim for my note-keeping system. I simply add a modeline to the top of the file,

<pre># vim: set ic hlsearch:</pre>

This makes searches case-insensitive, so I can just open the file and start typing a search, and it highlights it and moves to the first match as I type. It&#8217;s a great way to find something in a file. I have used this simple technique for many years to build a topical index over thousands of interesting email threads, code snippets, posts from bloggers, and customer issues. To use a buzzword, it scales as large as I need it to, and I can quickly find just about anything on any topic I&#8217;ve cared about in the past.

The remaining question is how to encrypt the file full of passwords. That&#8217;s what Sergio showed me in his comment. There&#8217;s a [GPG plugin for Vim][2] that detects that I&#8217;m opening a GPG-encrypted file and decrypts the buffer for me. This makes it incredibly easy to open, search, edit, and save the file. Much easier than Revelation. I found that the plugin didn&#8217;t properly encrypt the file (or I&#8217;m doing something wrong), so I first created the file as plain-text and manually encrypted it with GPG, and subsequently the plugin seems to work great.

I still might follow up on Sergio&#8217;s suggestions for building something on top of this. I&#8217;d really like integration with the desktop: press a key, start typing and seeing matches auto-complete, press TAB when I have the one I want, and copy the password. Maybe I will actually do this. Or maybe a hot-key to simply open Vim with the password file in a terminal is all I need.
