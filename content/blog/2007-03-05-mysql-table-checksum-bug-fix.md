  - I fixed a syntax error in MySQL Table Checksum version 1.0.1
---
I somehow introduced a syntax error into [MySQL Table Checksum][1] in the 1.0.1 release and didn't notice till just now. I've replaced the file in the Sourceforge release, but it may take a few hours for it to propagate to all mirrors. My apologies.
