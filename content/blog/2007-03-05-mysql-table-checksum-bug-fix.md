author: Baron Schwartz
excerpt: |
  <p>I somehow introduced a syntax error into <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysqltoolkit">MySQL Table Checksum</a> in the 1.0.1 release and didn't notice till just now.  I've replaced the file in the Sourceforge release, but it may take a few hours for it to propagate to all mirrors.  My apologies.</p>

I somehow introduced a syntax error into [MySQL Table Checksum][1] in the 1.0.1 release and didn't notice till just now. I've replaced the file in the Sourceforge release, but it may take a few hours for it to propagate to all mirrors. My apologies.
