I've had several customers in the last week or so who need a way to verify that their application will work well after an upgrade. I'm seeking input on [a new tool to help with MySQL upgrades][1]. Please add comments, either here or on the [bug report][1], or on [the mailing list topic][2].

If someone wants to sponsor this work, that would also be welcomed.
