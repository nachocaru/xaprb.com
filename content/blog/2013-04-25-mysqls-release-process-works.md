Years ago I complained bitterly about [MySQL's backwards development and release model][1], which made guinea pigs out of the paying customers. I think I'd be remiss if I didn't say [it's been fixed for years][2]. And it's really fixed right in my opinion &#8212; much better than what I proposed.

Congratulations, and thanks, to the MySQL team for superhuman software engineering, release engineering, documentation, bug triage and analysis, and doing a million things right &#8212; in other words, making a damn good database, which is *hard*. You know I still have gripes occasionally, and so do most people, but in the scheme of things &#8212; wow. MySQL is awesome.
