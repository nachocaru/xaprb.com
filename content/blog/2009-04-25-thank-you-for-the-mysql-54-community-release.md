MySQL 5.4 was released this week at the MySQL conference, and billed as the "community release." This seemed odd to some of us, and I heard lots of comment on it in the hallways. After all, the release was a surprise; the community didn't know it was happening.

A source from within Sun, who is familiar with the details and wishes to remain anonymous, told me the story behind the release. I want to say that after this conversation, I fully support the release of 5.4 and I want to praise it generously. It is a great step in lots of right directions! It's good for everyone. The secrecy was a necessary strategy.

The details must remain a secret, but perhaps someday it'll be known.

Thank you Sun!
