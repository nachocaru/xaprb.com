Sometimes there are funny communication styles between people who are geographically distributed and working together all the time. Recently one of our team members echoed back to me some answers I gave over a chat session:

> Q: Is it OK for me to buy quad-core servers?  
> A: The old man walks slow but carries much, whilst the young boy runs without a care.

Okay, okay maybe I wasn't very clear in my message, and maybe it was just a little bit Confucian. Here's what I actually said:

> Xaprb: 8 cores may be OK for some workloads  
> Xaprb: high-concurrency, not so good  
> Xaprb: discounts, yes

But I assure you, I would never write to a client this way. Only my colleagues.
