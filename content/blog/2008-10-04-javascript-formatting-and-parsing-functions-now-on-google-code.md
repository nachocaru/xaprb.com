It's been a while since I have updated my JavaScript formatting and parsing functions, and people have been posting comments on them. Unfortunately my interests have really turned elsewhere, and I'm not much in the world of frontend web design anymore. There's good news though: now I've made it easy for you to get the code, change the code, document it, report issues on it, and so forth. I've hosted the code at Google Code.

The project is called [flexible-js-formatting][1] and includes my fast,flexible formatting and parsing functions for dates, times and numbers. As a bonus, I threw in the code for the Date Chooser and the HTML Input Mask, so pretty much everything is there.

All you need to do is grab a copy of the Subversion repository and hack to your heart's content. One person has already contributed some work to reorganize the files and add some of his own patches.

If you're looking to make the code better, you can scan the comments on my old posts for user-suggested improvements that never made it into the code.
