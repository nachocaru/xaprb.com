I'm not using my previous combination of Bad Behaviour + WP-Gatekeeper anymore. I've removed them in favor of ordinary reCAPTCHA. Although it lets a lot of spammers through (almost a thousand spam comments in the day I've had it enabled) and Bad Behaviour let only 1 or 2 a month through, it became clear that a lot of people were getting blocked wrongly by Bad Behaviour.

This means that I can't practically moderate the spam queue. If you submit a comment and it doesn't get published, you either went into the spam queue that I ignore, or I decided to censor you ;-) Feel free to email me if you think anything's wrong.
