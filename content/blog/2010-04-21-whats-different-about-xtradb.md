The video of my [5-minute Ignite talk on XtraDB][1] is up on YouTube. Ignite talks have exactly 20 slides on auto-advance every 15 seconds. &#8220;Enlighten us, and make it fast!&#8221; It&#8217;s better than a lightning talk. I explained the difference between Percona XtraDB and other technologies such as standard MySQL, OurDelta, and MariaDB.
