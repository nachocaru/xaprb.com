You can pre-order the new edition of High Performance MySQL now on [Amazon][1] or via [O&#8217;Reilly&#8217;s website][2].

Eric Bergen called the second edition &#8220;[the best MySQL book on the planet][3]&#8220;. What will the third edition be called? The best in the solar system? This reminds me of a joke, supposed to be a true story: three pizza restaurants next to each other had signs saying &#8220;best pizza in town,&#8221; &#8220;best pizza in the world,&#8221; and &#8220;best pizza on this block.&#8221;
