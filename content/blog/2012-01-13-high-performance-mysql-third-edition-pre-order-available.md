You can pre-order the new edition of High Performance MySQL now on [Amazon][1] or via [O'Reilly's website][2].

Eric Bergen called the second edition "[the best MySQL book on the planet][3]". What will the third edition be called? The best in the solar system? This reminds me of a joke, supposed to be a true story: three pizza restaurants next to each other had signs saying "best pizza in town," "best pizza in the world," and "best pizza on this block."
