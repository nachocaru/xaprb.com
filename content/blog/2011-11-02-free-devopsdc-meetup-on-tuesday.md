Next Tuesday I'll be speaking at the [DevOpsDC meetup][1] at [CustomInk's][2] offices. I'll talk about why MySQL downtime happens and what you can do to avoid or prevent it. This is a research-based talk (but it's not scientific&#8230; they're different) that draws on hundreds of downtime issues I've studied. The related [white papers are available on Percona's website][3]. Hope to see you there!
