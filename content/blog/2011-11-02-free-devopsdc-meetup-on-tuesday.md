Next Tuesday I&#8217;ll be speaking at the [DevOpsDC meetup][1] at [CustomInk&#8217;s][2] offices. I&#8217;ll talk about why MySQL downtime happens and what you can do to avoid or prevent it. This is a research-based talk (but it&#8217;s not scientific&#8230; they&#8217;re different) that draws on hundreds of downtime issues I&#8217;ve studied. The related [white papers are available on Percona&#8217;s website][3]. Hope to see you there!
