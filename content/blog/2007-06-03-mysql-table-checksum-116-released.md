MySQL Table Checksum 1.1.6 enhances chunking, adds features and fixes bugs. The chunking functionality is where I continue to put most of my effort. **This release&#8217;s behavior is incompatible with the last release**, and it will probably change again in the future.

Thanks to everyone who has been helping me chase down bugs, including one user who sent me a major patch! It&#8217;s a great feeling to get a patch.

### Changes

Incompatible changes:

*   The chunking functionality no longer guarantees chunks will be no larger than the specified size. Use &#8211;chunksize-exact for that. Note that the chunking functionality is still experimental and likely to change further.

Changes:

*   Chunking now works with multiple-column indexes.
*   Added &#8211;quiet option, useful for cron jobs with &#8211;replicate.
*   Added &#8211;float-precision option; works around different floating-point formats.
*   Added &#8211;sleep-coef option; sleeps a multiple of the time the last checksum took.
*   Added error handling for tables that are dropped during checksumming.
*   Added documentation on the finer points of &#8211;replicate-do and &#8211;binlog-do.

Bugs fixed:

*   There was a race condition between listing and checksumming tables.
*   Perl&#8217;s auto-vivify hashes could cause all tables to be skipped after the first VIEW.
*   Some DBIs did not consider ? inside a comment to be a placeholder.
*   Systems that return nothing from CHECKSUM TABLE crashed mysql-table-checksum.
*   &#8211;askpass did not print a newline after reading password.
*   Different TIMESTAMP display formatting could cause spurious checksum differences.
*   Checksumming by chunks did not work when the chunk column contained NULL.
*   &#8211;replicate did not always work correctly with binlog\_do\_db.
