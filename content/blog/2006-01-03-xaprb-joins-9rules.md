Xaprb is now part of the [9rules][1] network. It&#8217;s an honor and a pleasure. The best part is what Mr. Scrivens said about me:

<blockquote cite="http://9rules.com/blog/2006/01/xaprb/">
  &#8230;the type of guy I would set next to in Calc class and watch him hacking the hell out of his TI calculator&#8230;
</blockquote>

My friends got quite a kick out of that. So did I, actually. Even being accepted to the network is a nice compliment, but this made me grin a big grin.

And for the record, I&#8217;ve always been a fan of the HP48GX, for two reasons: a) nobody uses TI in real life, only in the classroom (but if you&#8217;re an engineer, surveyor, etc you *will* use the HP) and b) Reverse Polish Notation is so much fun. Maybe it&#8217;s only *my* brain that thinks in stack operations, but seriously, <tt>1 enter 1 plus</tt> is so much more logical than <tt>1 plus 1</tt>.

Onward and upward!
