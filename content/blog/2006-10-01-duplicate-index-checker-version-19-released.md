I've made more improvements to the [duplicate index checker][1]. I addressed a [MySQL bug][2] [Roland Bouman][3] mentioned to me, added more tests to the suite, and made changes so it considers more types of indexes now ([HASH][4], BTREE, [SPATIAL][5]). I made no changes to the foreign key checking.

The [bug Roland mentioned][2] is a problem with `SHOW CREATE TABLE` that causes MySQL to show an index as type HASH when it's really a BTREE. I found a pretty easy workaround.

In the meantime, Roland has released a SQL-only method to find duplicate indexes in newer versions of MySQL. It's an excellent use of the INFORMATION_SCHEMA. He also wrote [an article on finding duplicate indexes][6] for O'Reilly Database, and for his own blog too.

Daniel Schneller has also continued to work on a [Java implementation of a GUI tool to find duplicate and redundant indexes][7].
