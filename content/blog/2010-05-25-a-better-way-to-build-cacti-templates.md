The traditional way to build Cacti templates is through the Cacti web interface. This is an *enormous* amount of work, and the result is generally not very consistent or good quality. The process is too error-prone. You can export the templates as XML, but they tend to have problems such as version incompatibilities with other Cacti installations, and it&#8217;s hard to adapt them for user preferences such as different graph image sizes and polling intervals.

The way I build Cacti templates is exactly the opposite. I create a data structure in a file, which looks like many configuration file syntaxes you&#8217;ve probably worked with. It represents the graphs, templates, scripts, and so on. From this, a tool generates the XML template file, which is a universal template definition, and is a breeze to import into Cacti. It is completely consistent and has zero cruft in it. This process prevents errors, and the results are perfect every time. (There&#8217;s a test suite, by the way.)

All the tools, documentation, how-tos, examples, and pre-fabricated scripts and templates you need are at the [Better Cacti Templates][1] open-source project. If you want to build your own templates, pay special attention to [the documentation on creating graphs][2].
