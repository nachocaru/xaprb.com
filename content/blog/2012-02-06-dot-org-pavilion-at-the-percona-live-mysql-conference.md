Are you involved with an open-source project that&#8217;s interesting to MySQL users, such as Nginx, PHPMyAdmin, Drupal, Jenkins, PHP, and so on? Percona just published the application form for dot-org groups to have a [free expo hall booth][1] in the Percona Live MySQL Conference in April. ** Please submit your applications now, and tell your friends about this**, because a) the schedule for applying is very short, and b) space is limited.

For those of you who don&#8217;t know what this is, it&#8217;s another of the O&#8217;Reilly traditions we&#8217;re trying to continue. (We are trying very hard to make this event as close to a clone of O&#8217;Reilly&#8217;s as we can.) It&#8217;s a free table in the expo hall where people who participate in a non-commercial open source project can exhibit. I organized a Maatkit booth a few times in the past, and was always really grateful to O&#8217;Reilly for making the space available. Space in the expo hall is at a premium, but we think that these dot-org booths are even more valuable to the open-source projects and the conference attendees.

So, please tell your friends who care about open source, and ask them to tell their friends too. Let&#8217;s get some great open-source projects into the expo hall, alongside the commercial vendors!
