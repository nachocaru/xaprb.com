A now-famous quote that I probably don&#8217;t need to attribute: &#8220;First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.&#8221;

Where is Drizzle in this lifecycle? I&#8217;ve been hearing and reading some comments to the tune of &#8220;those Drizzle guys think it&#8217;s easy to rip MySQL stuff out and start over, wait till they see how hard it&#8217;s going to get when the real world sinks in.&#8221; Maybe, maybe. But maybe not, too. Maybe not.

I&#8217;ve seen more than one software project that was belittled as &#8220;never gonna amount to anything, save your time&#8221; and went on to do quite well. Never underestimate the power of a handful of passionate and talented people. I personally feel that Drizzle has a bright future.
