I&#8217;ve seen a lot of silly non-standard datetime formats, but this one beats them:

<pre>Current Time                     : 6:11:14 2/19, 2009</pre>

Any guesses where that&#8217;s from?

Hint: think of a command-line tool that also has the silliest non-standard command-line argument format you&#8217;ve ever seen.
