People keep asking me &#8220;what is going to happen to MySQL now that Oracle has screwed MySQL?&#8221; I bluntly disagree that any such thing has happened. This blog post is just my personal view and does not reflect my employer&#8217;s opinion, but Oracle might have *saved* MySQL from what I can see. There is no evidence that supports the hysterical doomsday theories. (Witness MySQL 5.5, probably the best MySQL release in history. Not exactly what I&#8217;d call &#8220;screwing.&#8221;)

I believe that a product with such a large, diverse, and important market presence needs a variety of companies involved with it in many different ways. One of the absolutely key things is a company to make money from it. MySQL needs Oracle, because no one else involved is both capable and trying to make MySQL, the product, a large-scale commercial success. It looks like Oracle is doing what I wish Sun could have done.

Now, is Oracle going to be community friendly, and hold all our hands in a circle while singing songs and accepting our patches? No, of course not, and what an opportunity that creates for someone else. I have no issue with Oracle ignoring the community because they have decided it doesn&#8217;t fit into their plans. If you go to the hardware store to buy bread, you won&#8217;t find any. Bake a loaf if you want to eat.
