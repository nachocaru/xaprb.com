I think we&#8217;re beginning to see cloud computing mature a little bit. There is a long ways to go, but I am detecting more sober thinking on a wider scale. The events of last week, where many people were affected by Amazon&#8217;s outages, are helping clues sink in a little bit.

There are a lot of risks that don&#8217;t go away when you use cloud platforms. There are a lot of new risks that you&#8217;ll encounter. And yes, some problems are outsourced. But clear-headed thinking on &#8220;what is cloud computing about and what is it good for?&#8221; is still largely nonexistent on a broad scale. The din of the hype machine has most IT folks&#8217;s heads ringing and they can&#8217;t think straight.

Is that an over-generalization? I don&#8217;t think so. Go look at Twitter and I think you&#8217;ll see a pretty good representation of the general state of people&#8217;s thought processes around cloud computing. You can look at the four-page special advertising spreads and pull-out sections in the Wall Street Journal for the source of the confusion. A recent pull-out section told me that cloud computing is going to revolutionize even the nursery &#8212; who wants a baby monitor when you could have a laptop sitting in your nursery with a webcam watching the babies? That was over the top, but not too far. Most of what&#8217;s written about &#8220;cloud computing&#8221; is both ridiculously hyped and completely off-topic; writers will slap &#8220;cloud&#8221; on anything tech-related to get eyeballs on it. And that&#8217;s causing a general muddiness of the waters.

But this week, I heard some people thinking about questions like &#8220;if I rely on an external services provider for something, and there is an emergency that affects a lot of their customers, will I have to wait in line to get help for my own systems?&#8221; That&#8217;s sober thinking. We need more of that. A monoculture of any type is a problem. If I were building something on a cloud platform, I&#8217;d ensure that it was diversified not just across availability zones, but across completely different providers.

This is one reason why we need standardized APIs for managing cloud resources, but that&#8217;s a digression.
