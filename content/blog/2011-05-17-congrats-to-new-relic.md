New Relic just [announced the release of new features][1] that track client-side (front-end) performance, including network time, DOM processing time, and total render time in the browser.

This is really great functionality. If you aren't using New Relic, you really ought to. It is a web interface to application profiling. It helps you be scientific about performance analysis without knowing it, because the functionality and the user interface make the right thing so obvious you won't even realize you're being methodical and focusing on what matters. And it's got a free introductory level that isn't crippled. A great product just got greater.
