ODTUG invited me to give a webinar and I said yes, so this Thursday you&#8217;re invited to join me as I talk about MySQL performance. We&#8217;ve come a very long way towards a MySQL that can perform well on modern hardware, and there really isn&#8217;t broad recognition of this. A lot of the best work has gone into the InnoDB &#8220;plugin&#8221; storage engine, which was announced after my co-authors and I sent [High Performance MySQL][1] to the press. I will explain what you should be doing differently now than you did two years ago, and suggest a performance-in-a-nutshell configuration baseline for MySQL that&#8217;s quite different from what I&#8217;d have said in 2008. You can [register for free through GoToWebinar][2]. See you there.
