A couple of extremely informative recent blog posts have gone to either Planet MySQL or Planet PostgreSQL, but not both, and I think everyone on both aggregators who cares about database internals should be interested in them. Here they are:

*   [Robert Haas: MySQL vs. PostgreSQL, Part 2: VACUUM vs. Purge ][1]
*   [Ewen Fortune: How InnoDB handles REDO logging][2]

Happy cross-pollination.
