I&#8217;ll be attending [PgEast][1] this year, as I&#8217;ve done for the last couple of years, and this year I&#8217;ll also be speaking. The topic is [query analysis with mk-query-digest][2]. The official description of my talk is as follows:

> mk-query-digest is a powerful open-source tool for capturing, filtering, transforming, and aggregating queries, with the ability to do all sorts of other advanced tasks too. By default, it aggregates similar queries together and presents a designed-for-DBAs report with statistics about the most important queries, so you can see where to focus your optimization efforts. This talk shows you how to use mk-query-digest to analyze your Postgres server&#8217;s workload.

[PgEast 2010 has an impressive lineup of talks][3], which isn&#8217;t even complete yet. I&#8217;ve thoroughly enjoyed this conference [in][4] [the][5] [past][6], and it looks like this year will be better than ever.
