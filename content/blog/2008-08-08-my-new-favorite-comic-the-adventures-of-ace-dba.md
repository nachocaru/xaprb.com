I follow only a few comics in my feed reader: [Get Fuzzy][1], [Dilbert][2], [XKCD][3], and now [The Adventures of Ace, DBA][4]. It's kind of XKCD-ish, only it's about Oracle and it doesn't have the extra punch line when you hover your mouse over the picture. And it's proof that a DBMS (even one I don't use) can be pretty damn funny.
