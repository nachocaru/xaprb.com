[O&#8217;Reilly&#8217;s 2011 edition of the MySQL conference][1] has an expanded agenda, with good representation from Postgres, CouchDB, MongoDB, and others. Take a look at [the full schedule listing][2], which is being filled out as talks are approved and the speakers verify that they&#8217;ll give the session.

I am certainly looking forward to this year&#8217;s event. A tremendous amount of progress has landed in GA versions of open-source databases this year. To name just a couple, there&#8217;s a new version of Postgres (9.0) with built-in replication and many more improvements; there&#8217;s MySQL 5.5 GA; there&#8217;s the HandlerSocket NoSQL interface to MySQL; Drizzle has a beta release; and the list goes on. I believe that this conference will have balanced and representative coverage of what&#8217;s really important to users. It isn&#8217;t dominated by any vendor this year; O&#8217;Reilly is running the conference independently, and the committee members represent a broad spectrum of databases themselves.

In short, I am happier than I&#8217;ve ever been about this great and unique conference. It&#8217;s definitely going to be the best year so far. Thank you O&#8217;Reilly for holding it, and thank you to all the great speakers, and thanks to all the companies who sponsor the event.
