[O'Reilly's 2011 edition of the MySQL conference][1] has an expanded agenda, with good representation from Postgres, CouchDB, MongoDB, and others. Take a look at [the full schedule listing][2], which is being filled out as talks are approved and the speakers verify that they'll give the session.

I am certainly looking forward to this year's event. A tremendous amount of progress has landed in GA versions of open-source databases this year. To name just a couple, there's a new version of Postgres (9.0) with built-in replication and many more improvements; there's MySQL 5.5 GA; there's the HandlerSocket NoSQL interface to MySQL; Drizzle has a beta release; and the list goes on. I believe that this conference will have balanced and representative coverage of what's really important to users. It isn't dominated by any vendor this year; O'Reilly is running the conference independently, and the committee members represent a broad spectrum of databases themselves.

In short, I am happier than I've ever been about this great and unique conference. It's definitely going to be the best year so far. Thank you O'Reilly for holding it, and thank you to all the great speakers, and thanks to all the companies who sponsor the event.
