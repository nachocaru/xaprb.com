I&#8217;m going to present at the [EdUIConf conference 2009][1]. This is a conference focused in two directions: Web professionals in higher education, and higher education for web professionals. I believe it&#8217;s going to be comparable to, or at least in the same vein as, some of the more popular conferences about user interface design, Web standards, and the like. (It&#8217;ll also be much more affordable.)

The speaker lineup boasts a number of heavy hitters. I&#8217;m guessing those of you in the Web design profession will know the following name: [Molly Holzschlag][2]. If you don&#8217;t, crawl out from whatever rock you&#8217;ve been hiding under!

My own session at this conference will be on the topic of [Web front-end performance][3]. I&#8217;ve dubbed it [High-Performance Web Interface Design][3], and I&#8217;ll focus on a practical approach to performance. Nothing I&#8217;ll show you is revolutionary. The problem is, even though it&#8217;s not revolutionary to get good client-side performance, people don&#8217;t do it, and users suffer terrible interfaces that don&#8217;t download, render, or interact in a snappy fashion.

This will be a relatively fast-paced overview of Web front-end performance, and I&#8217;ll show you a demo of a badly performing website (such as the type I see often), make some changes to it, and let you see the performance difference.

If you register, I would appreciate you entering my name in the &#8220;how did you hear about this&#8221; text box. That will give me a chance to win a laptop. \*grin\*
