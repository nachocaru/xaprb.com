I wish I could be at this: [Percona Live San Francisco][1]. It is on February 16th. Cost is minimal, and content is maximal. The topic is on what's new in MySQL these days beyond 5.1: the new 5.5 release, HandlerSocket, MariaDB, and of course Percona Server.

This is a follow-up to the enormously successful Percona Performance Conference in 2009.
