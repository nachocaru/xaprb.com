I&#8217;ve posted [slides for my Velocity talk on VividCortex&#8217;s blog][1]. The talk explained how we use exponentially weighted moving statistics to generate a meta-metric of abnormality for the time-series metrics measured from MySQL. That&#8217;s kind of a mouthful. Maybe you had to be there :-)
