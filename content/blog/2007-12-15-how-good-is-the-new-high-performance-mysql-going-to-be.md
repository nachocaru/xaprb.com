But as it is, you're apparently going to have to settle for "very good."  This <a href="http://twitter.com/sheeri/statuses/485576042">quote</a> by Sheeri Kritzer Cabral, one of our tech reviewers, really made my day:</p>
  
  <blockquote cite="http://twitter.com/sheeri/statuses/485576042"><p>I gotta hand it to Peter, Vadim, Arjen, and Baron. They know how to write a book!</p></blockquote>
  
  <p>And now I must begin a solid weekend of revisions... wish me luck!</p>
