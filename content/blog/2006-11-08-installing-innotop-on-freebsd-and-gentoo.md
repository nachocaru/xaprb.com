    There are requests open to officially add support for innotop on FreeBSD and
    Gentoo.

I recently got a message letting me know FreeBSD users will soon be able to install the [innotop MySQL and InnoDB monitor][1] through ports. Gentoo GNU/Linux users can find innotop in Portage.

### FreeBSD adds innotop to ports

When this is finalized, FreeBSD users will be able to install innotop with the following commands:

<pre>cd /usr/ports/databases/innotop
make all install</pre>

This is great news. It makes innotop easier to find, install and use. It also means a lot to me that a FreeBSD maintainer thinks innotop is worth including in ports.

You can track the status of the PR at [ports/104722: New port: databases/innotop][2].

### innotop ebuilds for Gentoo

I've had an [open request to add innotop on the Gentoo bug system][3] for a long time, and it appears to have stagnated, but you can [download ebuilds for innotop][4] anyway. Since I'm no Gentoo developer, please do give feedback if you have any.

Since the Gentoo bug doesn't seem to be getting any attention, I've also opened an [innotop new-ebuild bug report with the fine folks at breakmygentoo][5]. This might result in innotop being included in their Portage overlay.

**Edit** One of the Gentoo developers saw this post and added innotop to the main Portage tree! Thank you! Gentoo users can now install innotop like this:

<pre>emerge innotop</pre>

Yay!
