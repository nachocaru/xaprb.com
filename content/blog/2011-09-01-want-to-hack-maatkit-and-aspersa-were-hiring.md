As announced on the Maatkit and Aspersa mailing lists, Daniel and I have created a new toolkit that represents the union of the two, and will be focusing efforts on this Percona Toolkit moving forward. The goal is to make them simpler and significantly more powerful, and to create more tools. The tools will continue to be open-source, but will be developed primarily to meet our MySQL support and consulting staff's needs.

If you're interested in challenging software engineering in Perl and shell, then please [apply online][1]. You can work online from anywhere, but I strongly prefer someone in the Americas timezones.
