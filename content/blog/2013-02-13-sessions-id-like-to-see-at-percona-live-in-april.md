I'm really looking forward to this year's [Percona Live MySQL Conference][1]. This is always THE event of the year for me in the MySQL conference circuit. It's also the first year I haven't been a speaker! I've been a speaker since 2007 but this year things were too uncertain for me to submit a proposal in time.

As usual, the real highlight of the conference is seeing and talking to everyone. Technical sessions are also great, but honestly I can usually study up on technical things without going to a conference. However, nothing can replace the benefit of meeting all the dedicated MySQL community members in the hallways and at meals, and talking to MySQL-related businesses in the expo hall. Year after year, this conference has been what makes things happen: technical innovations, product launches, business initiatives, career changes, you name it &#8212; pretty much everything important in my personal career and business experience has started at this conference. The reason is the people. There is no other conference that gathers together such a large and diverse audience. This year I'll also be looking forward to it for another reason: I'm not at Percona anymore, so this will probably be my only chance to visit with a lot of my former coworkers. I miss you guys!

There are 4 full days of 7 concurrent tutorials and sessions with world-famous speakers, and you can only be in one place at a time. It's a great problem to have. Here is a selection of a few of my favorite sessions:

*   [Galera Cluster Best Practices ][2]
*   [Engine-independent persistent statistics with histograms in MariaDB][3]
*   [Tracking Page Changes for Your Database and Bitmap Backups][4]
*   [State of the Art for MySQL Multi-Master Replication][5]
*   [Using MySQL Performance Schema to debug performance issues][6]

With over 100 sessions to choose from, picking just a few as my favorites is kind of silly, but hopefully this gives you a sense of the flavor of this event. Actually, looking through the program has reminded me that this conference isn't just the best MySQL conference around. It's a great conference, period. I am hard-pressed to think of another conference I've ever attended with such an impressive schedule. Great job Percona, speakers, and conference committee!

If you haven't made plans to attend this conference, please take a few minutes and browse the [tutorial][7] and [session][8] (day [2][9], [3][10]) schedule. Now tell your boss you need to go, and get hustling on your registration, airfare, and hotel so you can get the best bookings and discounts. As always, I hope to see you there!
