It&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve sent any news about the [MySQL Cacti Templates][1] project I started a while ago. Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s new:

*   First of all, it&#8217;s not just MySQL templates anymore. It&#8217;s a generic framework and tools for creating templates, and I&#8217;ve written templates for Apache, Memcached, etc. I just haven&#8217;t publicized it yet.
*   Second, there&#8217;s a mailing list, <http://groups.google.com/group/better-cacti-templates> You see it&#8217;s called &#8220;better cacti templates&#8221; which is what I ought to have called the project to begin with :-) I hope you&#8217;ll use the mailing list instead of emailing me directly, for all the usual reasons.
*   There are some open issues I cannot reproduce. I believe they&#8217;re problems, but I can&#8217;t solve them. Some of them make no sense to me; I don&#8217;t know why others are seeing behavior I&#8217;m not. However these *seem* to be problems with Cacti, not problems with the templates. Anyone who wants commit access is welcomed to ask for it.
*   Some people have been asking about Spine. I haven&#8217;t used it and none of my customers has asked me about it, so the short answer is &#8212; if you want Spine support, don&#8217;t wait for it to happen for free; either contribute it yourself or pay someone (me?) to do it.
