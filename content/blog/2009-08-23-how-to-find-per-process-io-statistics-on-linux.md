Newer Linux kernels have per-process I/O accounting and you can use the iotop tool to find out what&#8217;s performing I/O, but in many cases I&#8217;m trying to find the source of an I/O problem in an older kernel. I found sort of a hack-ish way to do that today, while trying to figure out why a system was basically unresponsive.

I found [a post on Stack Overflow][1] that showed a way you can get per process I/O statistics from the kernel even in older kernels. I adapted this to my needs, and wrote a little script.

Here&#8217;s how you use it. First, get it:

<pre>wget http://aspersa.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/iodump
</pre>

Then turn on kernel messages about I/O:

<pre>echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/block_dump
</pre>

This makes the kernel start writing messages about every I/O operation that takes place. Now all you have to do is get those messages and feed them into my script:

<pre>while true; do sleep 1; dmesg -c; done | perl iodump
</pre>

Wait a little while, then cancel the script. The results should look something like the following:

<pre>root@kanga:~# while true; do sleep 1; dmesg -c; done | perl iodump
^C# Caught SIGINT.

</pre>

I deliberately generated a bunch of I/O by deleting my Firefox history and cache.

Got any better ideas, warnings, etc? Post them in the comments.
