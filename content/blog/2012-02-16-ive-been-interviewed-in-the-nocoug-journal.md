The [Northern California Oracle Users Group (NoCOUG)][1] just published an interview with me in their journal. It's titled "A Whole New World of MySQL". You can read it in the [full journal (PDF)][2], or on [Iggy Fernandez's blog][3]. The full journal is well worth a read; there's a lot of good information.

Thanks to Iggy for such a thought-provoking interview, and for inviting me to participate!
