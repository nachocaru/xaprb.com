The [Northern California Oracle Users Group (NoCOUG)][1] just published an interview with me in their journal. It&#8217;s titled &#8220;A Whole New World of MySQL&#8221;. You can read it in the [full journal (PDF)][2], or on [Iggy Fernandez&#8217;s blog][3]. The full journal is well worth a read; there&#8217;s a lot of good information.

Thanks to Iggy for such a thought-provoking interview, and for inviting me to participate!
