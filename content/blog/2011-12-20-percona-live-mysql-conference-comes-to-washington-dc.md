If you are using or considering MySQL, and you&#8217;re in the Washington DC area, there&#8217;s an excellent MySQL conference coming up on January 11th. I know because I am helping organize it.

The event is [Percona Live][1]. It&#8217;s the latest installment in our series of regional events, which have been very well received in New York, London, and San Francisco. Take a look at the [schedule][2] of talks &#8212; this will be a very solid day of learning and networking.
