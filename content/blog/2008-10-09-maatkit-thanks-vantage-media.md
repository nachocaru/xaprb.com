I just wrote about how [Maatkit has gotten some new features][1] for helping people make sure their slaves have an exact copy of the master's data. This work was largely sponsored by one of [Percona][2]'s customers, whose name I have permission to mention: [Vantage Media][3].

Thanks Vantage! Your sponsorship helps many people and businesses.
