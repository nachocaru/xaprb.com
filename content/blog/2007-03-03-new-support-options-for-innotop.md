title: New support options for innotop
author: Baron Schwartz
excerpt: |
  <p>Now that I have innotop hosted on sourceforge, I'd like to use the tools they provide, especially the forums and mailing lists.  I've set up an <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=186074">innotop-discuss mailing list</a>, which I hope you'll find a better way to get support than posting in the comments on this blog.  I think I will close comments on all innotop-related articles I post, because I can't keep track of feedback in so many places.</p>

Now that I have [innotop][1] hosted on sourceforge, I&#8217;d like to use the tools they provide, especially the forums and mailing lists. I&#8217;ve set up an [innotop-discuss mailing list][2], which I hope you&#8217;ll find a better way to get support than posting in the comments on this blog. I think I will close comments on all innotop-related articles I post, because I can&#8217;t keep track of feedback in so many places.

Sourceforge also provides a bug tracker and other tools, which you are welcome to use. Do whatever seems right to you!

As a side note, my employer uses [Trac][3], which I adore. It is *such* a nice system. It&#8217;s wonderful to have bugs, wiki, mileposts and source control integrated. Sourceforge&#8217;s tools are great, but they feel a little clumsy and slow compared to Trac.
