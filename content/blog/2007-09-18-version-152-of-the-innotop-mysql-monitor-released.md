This release is part of the unstable 1.5 branch. Its features will ultimately go into the stable 1.6 branch. You can download it from the [innotop-devel package][1].

The major change is I've ripped out the W (Lock Waits) mode and enabled innotop to discover not only what a transaction is waiting for, but what it holds too. The new mode that replaces W is L (Locks). My last article goes into more detail on this.
