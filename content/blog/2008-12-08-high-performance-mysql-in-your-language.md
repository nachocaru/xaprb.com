[O'Reilly][1] tells me that translation rights for our book, [High Performance MySQL Second Edition][2] have been purchased in the following languages:

*   Korean
*   Russian
*   Portuguese
*   Polish
*   Spanish
*   Czech

Some of them were sold quite a while ago, and some are more recent. Portuguese was the first. I'm looking forward to learning all these languages (except for Spanish, which I already sort of know) so I can read the book in them&#8230; in my copious spare time!
