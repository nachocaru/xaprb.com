title: Maatkit on Ohloh

  <p><a href="http://sheeri.net/">Sheeri </a>wrote a post (now a 404 error) referring to <a href="http://maatkit.sourceforge.net/">Maatkit </a>on <a href="http://www.ohloh.net/">Ohloh</a>, which I have never heard of before.  I took a look at <a href="http://www.ohloh.net/projects/10083">what Ohloh thinks about Maatkit</a>.  It's kind of neat.  Beyond just the obvious "social website" stuff that's all the rage these days, it actually looks at the project's SVN history, analyzes the codebase, and so on.</p>
  
  <p>It also estimates 8 person-years of work have gone into the project, and says that at $55,000/year it would cost $450,702 to write the code as it currently exists, which is kind of funny.  It took me a whole lot less than 8 years to write.  (Perhaps this is why that salary strikes me as unrealistic).</p>
  
  <p>It has a couple of other interesting things, like a visual timeline of source control commits, analysis of licenses it finds in the code, analysis of programming languages, and so on.  Really pretty neat overall.</p>

[Sheeri ][1]wrote a post (now a 404 error) referring to [Maatkit ][2]on [Ohloh][3], which I have never heard of before. I took a look at [what Ohloh thinks about Maatkit][4]. It&#8217;s kind of neat. Beyond just the obvious &#8220;social website&#8221; stuff that&#8217;s all the rage these days, it actually looks at the project&#8217;s SVN history, analyzes the codebase, and so on.

It also estimates 8 person-years of work have gone into the project, and says that at $55,000/year it would cost $450,702 to write the code as it currently exists, which is kind of funny. It took me a whole lot less than 8 years to write. (Perhaps this is why that salary strikes me as unrealistic).

It has a couple of other interesting things, like a visual timeline of source control commits, analysis of licenses it finds in the code, analysis of programming languages, and so on. Really pretty neat overall.

There&#8217;s also the ubiquitous popularity rating: how many people have &#8220;stacked&#8221; the project. I notice it&#8217;s been stacked 3 times, coincidentally the same number as [MySQL Proxy][5]. It will be interesting to see how that changes over time.
