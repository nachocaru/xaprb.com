If you&#8217;d like some improvements to the Cacti templates (MySQL, Apache, Memcached, and more) I&#8217;ve been maintaining, please make your voice heard &#8212; either write to the [mailing list][1], or post a new issue (or comment on an existing one) on the [issue list][2]. I&#8217;ve got a bunch of work underway, including a test suite for ss\_get\_by_ssh.php.
