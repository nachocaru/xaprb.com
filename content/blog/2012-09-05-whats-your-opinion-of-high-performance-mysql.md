The second edition of High Performance MySQL has 27 reviews on Amazon, but the third edition only has 5 so far. By this point I assume many of you have a copy and have read it cover to cover. I'd really appreciate your reviews &#8212; when purchasing, people look not only at the star rating but at the number of reviews. You can create a review [here][1]. And thanks!
