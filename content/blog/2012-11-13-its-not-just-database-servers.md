Better performance is important in everything, not just MySQL. I don&#8217;t want to wait for my text editor to open a file or perform syntax highlighting. I don&#8217;t want to wait for my version control system to compute diffs or update my copy of the code with other peoples&#8217; changes. I don&#8217;t want to wait for my code to compile. I don&#8217;t want to wait, period.

Two tools I have enjoyed recently are Git and the Go language. Both are fast &#8212; very fast. It&#8217;s a welcome change after suffering from bzr and launchpad over the last couple years. If there is a slower or less efficient revision control program than bzr, I&#8217;m not aware of it.

Go compiles fast enough that it&#8217;s even a good scripting language. If Gentoo were written in Go, it would be no fun for its regular devotees to use &#8212; who wants to use an operating system that doesn&#8217;t give you enough time to savor that satisfying feeling of watching Xorg or LibreOffice compile for hours? You can probably tell that I don&#8217;t live for the thrill of watching &#8220;[> /dev/null 2>&1][1]&#8221; scroll up my terminal all day.
