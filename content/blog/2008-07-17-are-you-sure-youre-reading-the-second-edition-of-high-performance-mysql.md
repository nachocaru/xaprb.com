I have been getting a lot of comments and errata from people who seem to be mistakenly buying the first edition and believing it&#8217;s the second edition. A lot of the blame for this probably rests with Amazon, who did not distinguish between the two editions at all until the editor and I (among others) leaned on them persistently for about 6 weeks. I think some people are buying the second edition and getting the first edition.

I&#8217;ve even spoken to people in person who said &#8220;yeah, I&#8217;ve been reading it&#8221; and I give them a copy of the second edition to hold in their hands, and they go &#8220;whoa, that is like twice the size. I don&#8217;t have this edition at all.&#8221;

If you have any question at all, just look at the front cover. If you have the second edition, you will see it clearly in the upper right-hand corner of the cover, as shown in this picture:

I feel like a Microsoft Anti-Piracy Minion &#8220;educating&#8221; you about how to verify that you are installing Genuine Spyware. Don&#8217;t worry, the feeling will pass and I&#8217;ll be okay \*grin\*

If you ordered the second edition and got the first edition, Amazon should send you a new book free of charge. If they&#8217;re really making the mistake that they seem to be, I predict they&#8217;ll fix it when it starts costing them money.
