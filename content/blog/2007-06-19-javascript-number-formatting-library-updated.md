I've released a new version of my [powerful, flexible, efficient JavaScript number-formatting library][1], which is probably the best available. This release adds a fix for zero-padding negative numbers.

If you find bugs, please send me test cases I can use to reproduce and add to the unit test suite. One test per line, like "input", "format", "expected" is best. For example, this is a great test case:

<pre>-1, "#,#.00", "-1.00"</pre>

I can plug that directly into the unit test suite, run it, and if it gives back "-01.00&#8243; it will fail the test. This makes it much easier and more convenient for me to fix bugs.

[Sponsoring][2] bug fixes wouldn't hurt either ;-)
