O&#8217;Reilly isn&#8217;t the only excellent tech publisher, but they&#8217;re the one whose books most consistently give me pleasure to read. After going through the process of writing two books with them, one of the things that&#8217;s struck me is how much they invest into the thankless tasks such as indexing, proofreading, and copyediting their authors&#8217; work.

There are probably many steps in the production process &#8212; what happens after the author &#8220;finishes&#8221; the book &#8212; that I know nothing about. But these are areas where I&#8217;ve had enough opportunity to see the specialists in action to understand that it&#8217;s brutally hard work, which must also be quite expensive for O&#8217;Reilly. And yet there are few things that make a book less enjoyable to me than a crappy index, confusing writing, or obvious lack of proofreading.

As an author and a perfectionist, I appreciate O&#8217;Reilly&#8217;s investments in these areas even more than I used to. I&#8217;ve even reviewed a topical book from another publisher that misspelled the product name on the back cover in one-inch-high font! Every time I think about my book, I feel glad that I&#8217;m with O&#8217;Reilly instead of one of the other publishers who might try to save money by sending my book to the press unpolished.
