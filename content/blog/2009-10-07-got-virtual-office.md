A friend of mine works for a company that&#8217;s starting a place called [OpenSpace][1]. They did a [funny YouTube ad][2] for it. If you work from home, give it a look &#8212; it brought a smile to my face. I love the &#8220;trying to write on a whiteboard way down low&#8221; thing. That is pretty much the norm for me, because I&#8217;m tall. They are hoping for viral marketing to help OpenSpace succeed. Does this blog post count?

Oh yeah, and I visited the place today. It&#8217;s the hipness. Like Pixar&#8217;s or Google&#8217;s headquarters. Not what you expect to see in little old Charlottesville, Virginia!
