I&#8217;m not sure this has been publicized much in the PostgreSQL world yet, but the [Percona Performance Conference][1] is not a MySQL-centric event. We&#8217;re hoping for good sessions on PostgreSQL and lots of other topics. So this is an invitation &#8212; come attend, and submit sessions.

A few words about marketing. The event is free, and even though it&#8217;s stamped with Percona&#8217;s name and under Percona&#8217;s control, it is a technical event. If you want to present, you will be welcome to bring some marketing materials for your company. We&#8217;ll have something like a table for pamphlets and books. If you would like to present on a commercial product, it&#8217;s fine; and it&#8217;s okay to mention what you do or what your company does &#8212; we&#8217;re not trying to cramp anyone, but we&#8217;re looking for technical sessions. We&#8217;ll be doing the same thing. We&#8217;re renting a booth in the expo hall to do marketing.

We hope this will be an opportunity to get together and learn and teach; there isn&#8217;t really a PostgreSQL event on the west coast until later this year. I&#8217;ve made phone calls and sent emails to a lot of my PostgreSQL friends, but I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m missing someone &#8212; I just went through my business card collection. Spread the word!
