What's going on at your favorite open-source database developer mailing list? Non-scientific memory of what I've been seeing lately:

*   The [Drizzle list][1] is talking about test coverage and completeness, and schedulers.
*   The [MySQL internals list][2] has recently been dominated with talk about coding standards.
*   The [PostgreSQL hackers list][3] is talking about a ton of stuff. I don't even try to keep up.
*   The [Percona launchpad list][4] is talking about bugs, xtrabackup, and more bugs and patches for them. There's also a [Percona Google Group][5] that is not very active. In fact there are several Percona lists; it looks a little confused.
