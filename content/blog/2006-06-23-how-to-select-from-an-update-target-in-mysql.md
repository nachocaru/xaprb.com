MySQL doesn&#8217;t allow referring to a table that&#8217;s targeted for update in a `FROM` clause, which can be frustrating. There&#8217;s a better way than creating endless temporary tables, though. This article explains how to update a table while selecting from it in a subquery.

### The problem

Suppose I want to update a table with data from a subquery that refers to the same table. I might want to do this for a variety of reasons, such as trying to populate a table with its own aggregate data (this would require assignment from a grouped subquery), updating one row from another row&#8217;s data [without using non-standard syntax][1], and so on. Here&#8217;s a contrived example:

<pre>create table apples(variety char(10) primary key, price int);

insert into apples values('fuji', 5), ('gala', 6);

update apples
    set price = (select price from apples where variety = 'gala')
    where variety = 'fuji';</pre>

The error message is `ERROR 1093 (HY000): You can't specify target table 'apples' for update in FROM clause`. The MySQL manual mentions this at the bottom of the [UPDATE documentation][2]: &#8220;Currently, you cannot update a table and select from the same table in a subquery.&#8221;

It&#8217;s pretty easy to work around the problem in this contrived example, but there are times when it&#8217;s not possible to write the query without subqueries that refer to the update target. There is a workaround, though.

### The workaround

Since MySQL materializes subqueries in the `FROM` clause ([&#8220;derived tables&#8221;][3]) as temporary tables, wrapping the subquery into another inner subquery in the FROM clause causes it to be executed and stored into a temporary table, then referenced implicitly in the outer subquery. The following statement will succeed:

<pre>update apples
   set price = (
      select price from (
         select * from apples
      ) as x
      where variety = 'gala')
   where variety = 'fuji';</pre>

If you want to know more about how this works, read the relevant section in the [MySQL Internals Manual][4].

### Problems this trick doesn&#8217;t avoid

One common frustration this doesn&#8217;t solve is the issue of badly optimized queries in the `IN()` clause, which are rewritten as correlated subqueries, sometimes (usually?) causing terrible performance. Wrapping the subquery in another subquery doesn&#8217;t prevent the optimizer from rewriting it as a correlated subquery, though, unless I go to extremes. In any case it&#8217;s better to just [rewrite such a query as a join][5].

Another thing it won&#8217;t do is allow a query to refer to a temporary table more than once. Neither of these issues is solvable with the &#8220;wrap it in a subquery&#8221; trick because they are created at query compile time, whereas the update issue I was able to solve above happens at query run time.

**Update 2006-08-29** The queries I&#8217;ve given here are sloppy, performance-wise. You don&#8217;t want to just `select * from table` in the subquery in real life; I just wanted to keep the examples simple. In reality you should only be selecting the columns you need in that innermost query, and adding a good `WHERE` clause to limit the results, too.
