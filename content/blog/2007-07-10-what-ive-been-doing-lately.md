title: 'What I&#8217;ve been doing lately'
author: Baron Schwartz
excerpt: |
  <p>I haven't been blogging about the things I used to -- how-tos and technical hacks -- because I've been working quite hard on <a href="http://mysqltoolkit.sourceforge.net/">MySQL Toolkit</a> and, believe it or not, <a href="http://innotop.sourceforge.net/projects/innotop/">innotop</a>.  I've made it possible to write innotop plugins, which have been very useful to our team at work, and I'm working on documentation.  Plugins won't make it into the upcoming release; it'll just be bug fixes and documentation.  These projects have taken up most of my free time.</p>
  
  <p>I've also tentatively joined a group of people working on a very large, exciting, secret project which may consume the rest of my summer and/or much of the rest of the year.  (I've been turning down consulting gigs and other projects because of this).  If this secret project works out, I'll be writing more about it here, you can count on that.</p>
  
  <p>In the meantime, I'm still planning to finish some of the work I've started on MySQL Table Sync, which I continue to need because of a replication bug I haven't been able to isolate.</p>
  
  <p>Someday, maybe even soon, I might finish some of my 60+ drafts, such as "how to implement event listeners and notification in MySQL."  But I think the other projects I'm working on are much more important and beneficial to many more people, so I have prioritized them.</p>
  
  <p>I had a slight glitch with my <a href="/blog/donate/">Amazon wishlist</a>.  I was on vacation and when I came back, I saw about half a dozen things purchased from it, but I haven't received any of them (thank you, whoever you are!).  I didn't really understand how the wish list worked, so I didn't know I needed to specify a shipping address.  I assumed Amazon would send them to my primary shipping address.  Well, apparently that didn't work, and in the meantime I also realized Amazon was sending mail somewhere I couldn't receive it, so I'm not sure what is really going on.  I've specified an address now, and I'm hoping that takes care of it.</p>

I haven&#8217;t been blogging about the things I used to &#8212; how-tos and technical hacks &#8212; because I&#8217;ve been working quite hard on [MySQL Toolkit][1] and, believe it or not, [innotop][2]. I&#8217;ve made it possible to write innotop plugins, which have been very useful to our team at work, and I&#8217;m working on documentation. Plugins won&#8217;t make it into the upcoming release; it&#8217;ll just be bug fixes and documentation. These projects have taken up most of my free time.

I&#8217;ve also tentatively joined a group of people working on a very large, exciting, secret project which may consume the rest of my summer and/or much of the rest of the year. (I&#8217;ve been turning down consulting gigs and other projects because of this). If this secret project works out, I&#8217;ll be writing more about it here, you can count on that.

In the meantime, I&#8217;m still planning to finish some of the work I&#8217;ve started on MySQL Table Sync, which I continue to need because of a replication bug I haven&#8217;t been able to isolate.

Someday, maybe even soon, I might finish some of my 60+ drafts, such as &#8220;how to implement event listeners and notification in MySQL.&#8221; But I think the other projects I&#8217;m working on are much more important and beneficial to many more people, so I have prioritized them.

I had a slight glitch with my [Amazon wishlist][3]. I was on vacation and when I came back, I saw about half a dozen things purchased from it, but I haven&#8217;t received any of them (thank you, whoever you are!). I didn&#8217;t really understand how the wish list worked, so I didn&#8217;t know I needed to specify a shipping address. I assumed Amazon would send them to my primary shipping address. Well, apparently that didn&#8217;t work, and in the meantime I also realized Amazon was sending mail somewhere I couldn&#8217;t receive it, so I&#8217;m not sure what is really going on. I&#8217;ve specified an address now, and I&#8217;m hoping that takes care of it.
