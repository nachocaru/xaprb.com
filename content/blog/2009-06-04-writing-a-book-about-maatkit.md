I&#8217;ve decided to start writing a book about [Maatkit][1]. The working title is *Using Maatkit*. The goal is to provide another angle onto the tools; the docs are quite good in my opinion, but they only say what the tools do. The book will tell you how to use the toolkit to accomplish tasks.

I have no clue when it&#8217;ll be done. There is no schedule. At the current rate, it&#8217;ll take a while. I posted an [outline][2] to the Maatkit mailing list.

I have a few goals for the project. I want it to be printable-quality material (with an index and professional copyediting, which I have already figured out will cost me a pretty penny), but I also want to be able to update it quickly. I&#8217;ve had a number of discussions about this idea over the last year with folks in the publishing business, and although there&#8217;s potential for printing and selling it like a normal book, or doing a print-on-demand model, I think I&#8217;d like to take a slightly different approach.

Here&#8217;s what I think I&#8217;m going to do for the time being: You&#8217;d be able to buy it as a PDF online. After I release a new edition, I&#8217;ll post the old edition online for free, along with the TOC and some front matter, etc from the new edition.

My initial thought is that this would be a one-person perpetual license. I might also consider a company-wide license. Future editions would be a free upgrade. I&#8217;m not set on that path, though.

I wouldn&#8217;t encrypt the PDF; I&#8217;d just trust buyers with the honor system. I take it as a given that there&#8217;s no way to prevent unauthorized redistribution of the book. It did not take long for High Performance MySQL to be downloadable from all sorts of unethical sites as a PDF and in .chm format, so I think it&#8217;s futile to fight it.

On another note, I&#8217;m having fun with the project so far, and falling in love with LaTeX all over again. It is such a joy to work with after writing a huge book in a word processor without real version control.
