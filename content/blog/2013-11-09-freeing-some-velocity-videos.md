Following my [previous post on Velocity videos][1], I had some private email conversations with good folks at O'Reilly, and a really nice in-person exchange with a top-level person as well. I was surprised to hear them encourage me to publish my videos online freely! 

I still believe that nothing substitutes for the experience of attending an O'Reilly conference in-person, but I'll also be the first to admit that my talks are usually more conceptual and academic than practical, and designed to start a conversation rather than to tell you the Truth According To Baron. Thus, I think they're worth sharing more widely. 

O'Reilly alleviated my concerns about "killing the golden goose," but I like one person's take on the cost of O'Reilly's conferences. "You think education is expensive? Try ignorance." 

I'll post some of my past talks soon for your enjoyment.
