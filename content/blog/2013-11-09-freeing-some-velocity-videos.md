Following my [previous post on Velocity videos][1], I had some private email conversations with good folks at O&#8217;Reilly, and a really nice in-person exchange with a top-level person as well. I was surprised to hear them encourage me to publish my videos online freely! 
I still believe that nothing substitutes for the experience of attending an O&#8217;Reilly conference in-person, but I&#8217;ll also be the first to admit that my talks are usually more conceptual and academic than practical, and designed to start a conversation rather than to tell you the Truth According To Baron. Thus, I think they&#8217;re worth sharing more widely. 
O&#8217;Reilly alleviated my concerns about &#8220;killing the golden goose,&#8221; but I like one person&#8217;s take on the cost of O&#8217;Reilly&#8217;s conferences. &#8220;You think education is expensive? Try ignorance.&#8221; 
I&#8217;ll post some of my past talks soon for your enjoyment.
