Just thought I&#8217;d update you. We got quite a few good errata from readers, and I took a couple weekends and went through the book with a fine-toothed comb, catching typos and subtle errors that crept in at some point (TPC benchmarks were labeled as TCP benchmarks &#8212; did you catch that one?). I marked up my book and mailed it to O&#8217;Reilly, who went well above and beyond what they normally do for errata. Normally, once a book is in print they will fix only serious technical errors. They fixed everything, even going as far as rearranging page breaks and moving figures to improve readability.

The second printing is on Monday August 4th. Already! I think the book has been selling a lot better than anticipated. I know I am psyched to see it remain in the top couple thousand on Amazon. And they thought it was a big deal when it broke five thousand!

In other news, it&#8217;s going to be translated into Spanish, Polish, and Portuguese. So now all my friends in Brazil will be able to read it in their native language.

And Percona&#8217;s two expert consultants in Poland, too. No undue influence was exerted. I didn&#8217;t even know it would be translated. Really! We do have a Spanish-speaking consultant who lives in Spain, but he is a native English speaker. Now, all we need are Russian, German, Lithuanian, and Ukrainian translations and I think we&#8217;ve pretty well got the company covered, at least until we hire again.
