I wrote pt-archiver for jobs like deleting or archiving rows from a big table in small chunks. These days, that's the kind of task I like doing inside the database, and Shlomi's magical [common_schema][1] feels a lot more suited for this than an external Perl script.

When I say it's magical, it really does feel magical. It's amazing how he's created an entire expressive scripting language that runs in MySQL and feels just right for the job.

Right now I'm watching this kind of stuff scroll by in my terminal:

    +---------------------+
    | rows_deleted_so_far |
    +---------------------+
    |             2871119 |
    +---------------------+
    1 row in set (7 min 42.67 sec)
    
    +---------------------+
    | rows_deleted_so_far |
    +---------------------+
    |             2872119 |
    +---------------------+
    1 row in set (7 min 42.75 sec)

Notice that the execution time is steadily increasing. Each chunk of 50,000 rows takes a small amount of time to delete, but the time shown is since the beginning of the job's execution.
