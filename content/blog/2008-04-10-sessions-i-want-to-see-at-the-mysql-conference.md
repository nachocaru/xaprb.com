This year&#8217;s conference has a great lineup. As usual, with 8 sessions concurrently, it&#8217;s impossible to pick which ones I want to see. However, I did learn a few things from last year&#8217;s conference, which I think will help me get more out of it this time.

Number one rule: not all sessions are created equal. I can&#8217;t say for sure, but I&#8217;m pretty sure that when you see &#8220;How Product X Will Scale Your Databases&#8221; presented by a person from Company X, you can reasonably suspect that Company X is paying for this privilege, and it&#8217;s not really a session as much as a product demo. These sessions were not reviewed and voted on by the community (I know, because I was one of the community members who were asked to review and vote on proposals. Maybe I&#8217;m being a whistle-blower and won&#8217;t get this honor next year as a result&#8230;)

Number two rule: if the description is vague, or if it sounds like regurgitation, I&#8217;m skeptical. For example, if the summary starts off by saying &#8220;Today&#8217;s databases are dealing with more data than ever before. Data is mission-critical to today&#8217;s business enterprises&#8221; they lost me already. Writing that in a session description betrays thoughtlessness.

There actually are a couple of time slots that I am not really zinged about any of the sessions, and wish that I could see one of the sessions that&#8217;s happening while I&#8217;m presenting myself instead. But for the most part, there&#8217;s more goodness than I can actually take in.

This year the conference website has become Web 2.0ish, in a good way. It lets you browse the schedule, and if you&#8217;re logged in, you can &#8220;star&#8221; the ones you want to see. Then you get a personal calendar of all the ones you&#8217;ve starred. Not only that, but when you look at a session, it shows you other sessions that other attendees have also starred. Pretty nice, if you&#8217;re trying to figure out which sessions to see.

Here are the sessions I&#8217;ve starred, in chronological order. It&#8217;s a little too much work for me to link to them all.

*   All Bases Covered: A Hands-on Introduction to High-availability MySQL and DRBD
*   Memcached and MySQL: Everything You Need To Know
*   New Subquery Optimizations in MySQL 6.0
*   The Lost Art of the Self Join
*   EXPLAIN Demystified
*   High Availability Landscape of MySQL
*   Disaster is Inevitable &#8212; Are You Prepared?
*   Services Oriented Architecture with PHP and MySQL
*   Database Integrity Protection with MySQL and DRBD
*   Falcon from the Beginning
*   Architecture of Maria: A New Storage Engine with a Transactional Design
*   The MySQL Query Cache
*   Grazr: Lessons Learned Building a Web 2.0 Application Using MySQL
*   Extending MySQL
*   Inside the PBXT Storage Engine
*   Helping InnoDB Scale on Servers with Many CPU Cores and Disks
*   Scaling Heavy Concurrent Writes In Real Time
*   High Availability MySQL with DRBD and Heartbeat: MTV Japan Mobile Services

I might change my mind, but these look like a pretty good start.

Rule three: ask around. You can get the scoop, and it might make you change your mind. For example, would you go see the one about the &#8220;Lost Art of the Self Join&#8221; if I wasn&#8217;t here telling you how much you don&#8217;t want to miss that one?

Rule four: go to my sessions \*wink\*
