Microsoft Internet Explorer exposes the contents of the clipboard to JavaScript on websites. This is a bad thing.

Just another in the long string of examples how Microsoft, in an attempt to get developers on board and build the largest software empire in the world, has made everything easy for the developers, and totally disregarded security.

My personal opinion, as always, is Internet Explorer should never be used.
