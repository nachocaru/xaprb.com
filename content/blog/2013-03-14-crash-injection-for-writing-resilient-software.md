I am currently finishing some features to make a program highly resilient to occasional crashing bugs. A particular function was found to crash on queries of the form `WHERE x IN(NULL)`, and that crashed the entire program. Now we have a framework for intelligently recovering from arbitrary crashes. I will write more on this in the future, because I think it&#8217;s a very interesting thing to share.

In this episode, I want to focus on a related topic: how do you test a program that is supposed to be resilient to bugs you can&#8217;t predict? Many new problems are caused by writing [clever code that is supposed to detect, avoid, or recover from problems][1], even known problems. Unknown problems are even riskier.

The approach that has given me a great deal of confidence in the &#8220;resilience framework&#8221; is to write a &#8220;crash injection framework.&#8221; (If it&#8217;s not a framework, it can&#8217;t be any good, right?) Crash injection can be activated at runtime to cause crashes in arbitrary source code locations. A fairly simple analysis of the source code showed me some places I&#8217;m particularly interested in crashing to see how the program reacts.

In the first iteration, it turned out that I hadn&#8217;t actually solved the problem, even though I was sure I had. (I had already discovered previous mistakes, so this was actually about the 3rd time through, and I was sure I&#8217;d found all the bits I&#8217;d previously missed.) My crash injection framework allowed me to quickly dispel the notion that my program was resilient to the kinds of bugs we&#8217;d already found.

The fix was simple, but the lesson was well learned. I don&#8217;t remember doing this before, but I&#8217;ve studied and admired other pieces of software that are built to be resilient. For example, CouchDB has a [crash-only][2] design. If you&#8217;re not familiar with that phrase, it&#8217;s well worth reading more about that. Stewart Smith has also written software that helps reveal wrong assumptions, such as [libeatmydata][3], and I think he also wrote something that randomly broke `malloc()`, but I can&#8217;t find that easily. Assumptions like &#8220;allocating memory will always succeed&#8221; are great places to end up with horrible bugs.

In the MySQL world, it would be great if we had more crash-injection testing of InnoDB as well. If you agree, you might consider subscribing to <http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php> to keep up to date with effort on that front.
