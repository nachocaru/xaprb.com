The call for papers for the [MySQL conference's Ignite sessions][1] is open. These are a lot of fun: 5 minutes, 20 slides, period. Last year I spoke way too fast &#8212; if I do it again this year, I'll try not to cram so much into so little time. Either that, or I'll deliberately talk like Busta Rhymes.
