You're creating a document with Word that you want to turn into a nice full-page PDF. It has a gorgeous background color that will look great. But every time you convert it to a PDF, it ends up with ugly white borders at the edges, and Word warns you about printing beyond the printable margins. Dragging the margins and changing the Page Setup options does no good. How can you fix this?

The secret is that the printable margins are defined in the paper Word thinks
it's "printing" to, not in the document itself. You need to define a new set of
paper settings and use that. Then you can print "full-bleed" to the edge of the
document, including graphics, lines, text and background colors. Here's how:

Go to "File > Page Setup." In the "Paper Size" dropdown menu, select "Custom Paper Sizes." Here's what that looks like in a Mac.

Now add a new paper size, and call it "Full Bleed." Set the non-printable area to 0 on all sides. Here's what that should look like.

Now you're done. Your PDF document will look just as you see it in the visual
preview, including background colors and other elements that reach the edge of
the page.
