I note that [Maatkit has been deemed unworthy to mention on Wikipedia][1]. Someone emailed me the deletion log today:

I have never been a very big promoter. I prefer to let people promote things themselves, and I try for a policy of attraction rather than promotion myself.

With that said, I often hear people saying some variant of &#8220;Maatkit saved my behind, thanks so much. I use it all the time.&#8221;

But that&#8217;s my private email and phone calls. So now is your chance to say so in public. Put your love story in the comments, and let&#8217;s see if Maatkit is notable or not. Oh, and feel free to bring back the Wikipedia page if you think Wikipedia is notable enough that it&#8217;s important for Maatkit to be there ;-)
