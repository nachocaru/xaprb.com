Effective April 1, I will join [Percona][1] full-time as a consultant. I&#8217;ll be helping people build high-performance applications with MySQL, but I&#8217;ll also be continuing to develop and improve tools such as [Maatkit][2].

This career change has been a long time in progress. I&#8217;m really looking forward to it, but at the same time it&#8217;s hard to leave my current employer, [The Rimm-Kaufman Group (RKG)][3]. Working with them has been the best job I&#8217;ve ever had. But ultimately, my dream job is to help as many people as I can, and consulting will be a better way to do that.

At a time like this, I like to reflect on the trail that has led here. It&#8217;s a good opportunity to realize how fortunate I really am and fill up my gratitude tank. So I&#8217;d like to thank everyone who has helped me reach this point. All the people who have encouraged me, sponsored me, suggested new options&#8230; all kinds of help. A special thanks to my wife Lynn, to Alan Rimm-Kaufman and all my colleagues at RKG, to the many fine people at MySQL, and to the MySQL community as a whole. My deep gratitude to all of you. I look forward to working with you even more in the future.
