I&#8217;ve made plans to attend part of Saturday and part of Sunday at [PostgreSQL Conference East 2009][1]. I wish I could be there the whole time. Anyway I&#8217;m just thrilled that I&#8217;ll get to see people again, and meet new people I didn&#8217;t get to meet before.

<del datetime="2009-03-25T20:41:26+00:00">I think Josh Berkus has talked me into doing some kind of lightning talk on what the PostgreSQL community is doing right from my POV, and what parts of that I try to emulate in &#8220;other&#8221; areas of my professional life (if you know what I mean), though I can&#8217;t see how that can actually fit into a lightning talk. But that&#8217;s the point of a LT.</del> Hmm. So it turns out Josh was inviting me to to an LT at a [different PG conference.][2] Thanks xzilla for explaining to me.

I have a hotel room at the Sheraton right next to Drexel for Saturday night, and am hoping to split that with someone, or cancel it and share someone else&#8217;s room.

An item that may be of interest: I&#8217;ve been seeing a lot of twittering and various blogs, emails, comments on IRC, etc, to the effect of this comment I saw on #postgresql today:

> there are days where I&#8217;m very saddened that I&#8217;m that far away from the US of A   
> for example when I see something like this: <http://conferences.percona.com/percona-performance-conference-2009/schedule.html>
So I&#8217;d like to extend again a warm welcome to the PostgreSQL community to this event. You can [read more about it here][3].
