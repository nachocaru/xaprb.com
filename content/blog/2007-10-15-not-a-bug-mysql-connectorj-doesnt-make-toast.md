  <p>I was just searching for something and found this <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=2">MySQL bug report</a>:</p>
  
  <blockquote cite="http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=2">
  <p>Other JDBC drivers I have used make toast for breakfast... MySQL Connector/J doesn't make toast, it can only pour a bowl of froot loops...</p>
  <p>...Thank you for taking the time to write to us, but this is not
  a bug... I believe you should look into a device called a "toaster" to make your toast.</p>
