I was just searching for something and found this [MySQL bug report][1]:

<blockquote cite="http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=2">
  <p>
    Other JDBC drivers I have used make toast for breakfast... MySQL Connector/J doesn't make toast, it can only pour a bowl of froot loops...
  </p>
  
  <p>
    ...Thank you for taking the time to write to us, but this is not a bug... I believe you should look into a device called a "toaster" to make your toast.
  </p>
