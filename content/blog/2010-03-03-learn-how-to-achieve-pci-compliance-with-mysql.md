One of my colleagues, [Ryan Lowe][1], has just heard that his session on [PCI compliance with MySQL][2] has been accepted at the [upcoming MySQL conference][3]. Ryan is highly qualified to present this topic, and not many people can say that; I certainly can't claim that title myself. If you're looking to learn how to make your MySQL installation PCI-compliant, there's also not a lot of trustworthy information online. Personally &#8212; and really, no bias just because he's my colleague &#8212; I think this is a great session for the MySQL conference, which I sometimes thought didn't have enough diversity of topics in past years. We need more stuff like this to give people a reason to return after they've gone for 2 or 3 years in a row.
