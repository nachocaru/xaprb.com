The conference that many of us just went to is called the [MySQL Conference and Expo][1], but a lot of people don&#8217;t call it that. They call it by the name it had in 2006 and earlier: MySQL User&#8217;s Conference. In fact, some people say (or blog) that they dislike the new name and they&#8217;re going to call it the old name, because [... insert reason here...].

I call it by the new name that some people dislike so much. Why? Because it is a conference and expo, not a user&#8217;s conference. There&#8217;s no reason to pretend otherwise. The conference is organized and owned by MySQL, not the users. It isn&#8217;t a community event. It isn&#8217;t about you and me first and foremost. It&#8217;s about a company trying to successfully build a business, and other companies paying to be sponsors and show their products in the expo hall. Times have changed.

I&#8217;m not saying any of this is bad. Being successful in business is a good thing, and having sponsors and partners is fine too. I&#8217;m just pointing out that trying to make it be a user&#8217;s conference, just by calling it one, isn&#8217;t going to work.

If community members want a community conference, we&#8217;ll have to make one. MySQL/Sun cannot do this for us, because then it wouldn&#8217;t be a community conference.

There&#8217;s a simple test of whether people want this: if it happens, then the community wanted it badly enough to do something about it.

The [PostgreSQL East 2008 conference][2] I went to a few weeks ago was a great example of how this works. And the attendance fee was $75, not thousands. A conference doesn&#8217;t have to be expensive.

Who wants a conference by, for, and of the community?
