Attribute values in XML are usually double-quoted, but single-quotes can be used as well, according to the relevant part of the [XML Spec][1]. Here is the production:

<pre>[10] AttValue ::= '"' ([^&lt;&"] | Reference)* '"'
                  | "'" ([^&lt;&'] | Reference)* "'"</pre>

In plain English: an attribute consists of

*   a double or single quote
*   any number of the following: 
    *   any character but <, & or " OR
    *   an entity reference
*   the same character that was used to begin the attribute (double or single quote)

What's most interesting about this to me is that a < is forbidden inside attribute values, but a > is not. I always assumed both were illegal.

This is why I love reading specs. The XML spec is a great example of clear and terse writing. There is no chance for confusion when reading the productions themselves! Any secondary source can only obscure the matter, in my opinion.
