The third edition is nearly done. I've committed first drafts of all chapters, and all but one appendix. I need to do the last appendix and then rewrite the preface, which is a few days of work at my current pace. After that, it's the usual tech review, copyediting, updates to figures, etc -- and then it's off to production.

I'm really pleased with this edition. I was planning on it just being a refresh of the second edition to reflect what's new in MySQL-land, but it's almost a complete rewrite. There's a lot more focus on a logical approach throughout: what happens in the server, what are the limitations, why this matters, what are the practical consequences and applications, and therefore&#8230;. The "and therefore" is the real reason you buy a book such as this one.
