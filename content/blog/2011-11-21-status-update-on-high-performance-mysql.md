The third edition is nearly done. I&#8217;ve committed first drafts of all chapters, and all but one appendix. I need to do the last appendix and then rewrite the preface, which is a few days of work at my current pace. After that, it&#8217;s the usual tech review, copyediting, updates to figures, etc &#8212; and then it&#8217;s off to production.

I&#8217;m really pleased with this edition. I was planning on it just being a refresh of the second edition to reflect what&#8217;s new in MySQL-land, but it&#8217;s almost a complete rewrite. There&#8217;s a lot more focus on a logical approach throughout: what happens in the server, what are the limitations, why this matters, what are the practical consequences and applications, and therefore&#8230;. The &#8220;and therefore&#8221; is the real reason you buy a book such as this one.
