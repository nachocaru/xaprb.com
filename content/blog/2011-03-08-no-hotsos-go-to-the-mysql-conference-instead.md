I wish I could be at the [Hotsos Symposium][1]. I would keep my mouth very tightly closed and my ears wide open, and try to learn from people who are completely out of my league about [performance analysis topics I won't grok for another decade][2] (if I'm lucky). But I just can't cram in that much travel.

If you're like me, why don't you go to the [O'Reilly MySQL Conference][3] instead? I'll be trying my feeble best to bring some of the Oracle performance scientist's mentality to this event, with presentations such as my [Forecasting MySQL Performance and Scalability][4] session. And a lot of smart people will be there from many database communities. [Percona has a 20% discount][5], too &#8212; not a bad enticement.
