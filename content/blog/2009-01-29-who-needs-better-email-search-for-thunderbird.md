Thunderbird&#8217;s email search isn&#8217;t that great by today&#8217;s standards. If I type &#8220;red dog&#8221; into the search bar it doesn&#8217;t even tokenize and search for the words separately &#8212; it&#8217;s a substring match so &#8220;my dog is red&#8221; isn&#8217;t found. And it&#8217;s slow.

What about embedding &#8220;real&#8221; fulltext search into it? Sphinx perhaps?

Just a thought.
