Just a quick note: [Kickfire][1] is not based on SSD (solid-state device) hard drives. Their old website says &#8220;SQL goes solid state&#8221; but that just means SQL in hardware, not SSD.

When I was a child, we had a Sears Lady Kenmore clothes washing machine that boasted &#8220;solid-state circuits&#8221; on the panel, in flowery script writing. It was not based on SSD, either.

Finally, I am not on the Kickfire payroll. I&#8217;m not getting anything from working with them, except perhaps the fun of being in their labs while they&#8217;re still in stealth mode. It&#8217;s a harder balance than you might think, writing about a product that I don&#8217;t know about and am excited to learn about, and sounding objective. If I&#8217;m sounding like a fanboy, I don&#8217;t mean to. Trust me, if it&#8217;s vaporware you&#8217;ll hear it here first.
