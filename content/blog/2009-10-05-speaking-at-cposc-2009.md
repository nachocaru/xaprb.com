I'll be attending and presenting at the [2009 Central Pennsylvania Open-Source Conference][1]. My session is on Maatkit. I see Tom Clark has a session on MySQL performance! I hope to see you there -- I've really become a fan of these regional conferences.

By the way, I've also created a speaker badge by adapting a wallpaper someone else made -- you can find it on the sidebar of my blog if you're also a speaker.
