A kind soul has contributed a Debian/Ubuntu package for the [innotop MySQL and InnoDB monitor][1]. Thanks Sebastien Estienne!

You can find the package in the [source directory][2]. Sebastien wrote me that he tested it on Ubuntu Dapper Drake, and I just verified that it works on Edgy Eft.

Since I use Ubuntu on my own machine now, I may integrate this into my build process for future releases of innotop. But for right now, at least there's another installation option.
