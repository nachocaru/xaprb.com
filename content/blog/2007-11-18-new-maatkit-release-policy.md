  <p>Maatkit (formerly MySQL Toolkit) has for some time been released both as a bundle, and as individual tools.  It's too much work to maintain the individual packages, and I don't think it really benefits anyone much, if at all.  While the tools will still be versioned separately, I'm going to discontinue releases of the individual packages, and just release the one uber-package from now on.</p>
  
  <p>This will also make it easier for me to manage the name change, but that's just an extra incentive; I've been considering this for a while.</p>
  
  <p>By the way, Sourceforge indicated it would take up to a couple of days to finish the project's rename, but it took only a few minutes.  Lots of broken links; I've asked for a permanent redirect from the old URLs to the new.</p>

Maatkit (formerly MySQL Toolkit) has for some time been released both as a bundle, and as individual tools. It&#8217;s too much work to maintain the individual packages, and I don&#8217;t think it really benefits anyone much, if at all. While the tools will still be versioned separately, I&#8217;m going to discontinue releases of the individual packages, and just release the one uber-package from now on.

This will also make it easier for me to manage the name change, but that&#8217;s just an extra incentive; I&#8217;ve been considering this for a while.

By the way, Sourceforge indicated it would take up to a couple of days to finish the project&#8217;s rename, but it took only a few minutes. Lots of broken links; I&#8217;ve asked for a permanent redirect from the old URLs to the new.
