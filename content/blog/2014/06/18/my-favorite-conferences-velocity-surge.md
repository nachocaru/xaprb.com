Two of my favorite conferences are coming up. One's just next week, and
another's in the fall.

### Velocity

[Velocity](http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-7094008-11742203) is such a great event.
I wanted to go for years, and when I finally did it was honestly one of the
highlights of my professional career. I still don't know what I did get get
invited to speak that first year. It was a golden horseshoe falling out of the
sky and landing right in front of me.

It's not the talks (though those are great). It's the people. The people
at Velocity are the people I want to spend my career with, the people thinking
about the same types of problems I am, the people trying to work on similar
solutions. They're building companies, they're making open source, they're
customers, they're consultants, they're just passionate practitioners. It's just
amazing what happens when this kind of group gets together.

And yeah, it's partially because I'm a loyal O'Reilly fan. I admit it: I love
O'Reilly, I truly do. It's a remarkable group of people that has inspired me for
more than a decade, and I owe a lot of who I am to O'Reilly.

Velocity starts next Tuesday in Santa Clara. If you don't go to that one,
there's several other incarnations in New York, Barcelona, and Beijing at
different times of the year. I'll be in Santa Clara next week, in the
[VividCortex](https://vividcortex.com/) booth. Come say hi if you're there.

### Surge

I've often said that [Surge](http://surge.omniti.com/) is Velocity without the grandiosity and with more
emphasis on hardcore software and systems engineering --- and a much smaller
price tag.

I've been at every Surge event since the beginning, and I would not miss it.
It's that good. I can say all the same things about Surge as I can about
Velocity, except it's a lot easier and less expensive to get to, and it's a lot
easier to decide to attend the talks there. At Velocity sometimes I feel lost
because the event is so big, and I end up not really attending many
presentations, and just hanging out in the hallway track. Not so at Surge.
Bonus: talks are always recorded and online, so you can go find out for yourself
how good they are.

The climate at Surge is also quite different in terms of the topics. Velocity is
ostensibly about the Web: backend, frontend, browser, and mobile are front and
center. As a result, you can certainly find yourself in an unfamiliar clique, if
you're, say, a database administrator at a lunch table full of people who want to
argue about how much hardware acceleration will save battery life in a mobile
browser. Whether that bothers you or not is up to you, but I've found that Surge
is birds of my feather for sure. It's all about people who build what runs the
Internet (not necessarily what you use to engage with the Internet).

I'm pretty loyal to the folks behind Surge, too. For one thing, a lot of them
are the same people who make Velocity awesome. For another, many of them have
helped me tremendously in my career and in founding VividCortex.

Surge is in early-bird pricing right now. Having run conferences before, I know
why early-bird pricing exists. If you think you'll attend, do yourself and them
a favor and sign up at a discount now. Here, click [this](http://surge.omniti.com/2014).

### Conclusions

There are no conclusions. Conferences are good. I love Velocity. I love Surge.
Go. Learn a lot. Share a lot. Make the world a better place.
