I've been invited to give a Tech Talk at Google next Thursday, February 13th,
from 11:00 to 12:30 Pacific time. Unfortunately the talk won't be streamed live,
nor is it open to the general public, but it will be recorded and hosted on
[YouTube][1] afterwards. I've also been told that a small number of individuals might
be allowed to attend from outside Google. If you would like me to try to get a
guest pass for you, please tweet that to [@xaprb][2].

The topic is, roughly, databases. Officially,

> ### MySQL, SQL, NoSQL, and Open Source in 2014 and Beyond
>
> Predictions are hard to get right, especially when they involve the future.
> Rather than predict the future, I'll explain how I view the relational and
> NoSQL database worlds today, especially the MySQL product and community, but
> including open-source and proprietary data management technologies about which
> I know enough to get in trouble. I'll explain how my self-image as a
> practitioner and contributor has changed, especially as I've moved from
> consulting (where I tell people what they should do) into being a company
> founder (where I sometimes wish someone would tell me what to do). As for the
> future, I'll express my preferences for specific outcomes, and try to be
> careful what I wish for.

I am excited and a bit nervous. A Google Tech Talk! Wow! Thanks for inviting me,
Google!
