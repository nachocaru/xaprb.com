Have you heard of *sharding* a database? Of course you have. Do you know where
the term comes from? Someone asked me this at a cocktail party recently. I gave
it my best shot.

"The earliest I remember was Google engineers using it to describe the
architecture of some things," I said. "That would have been about 2006."

"Nope. Much earlier than that," said my new friend.

I pondered. "Well, I guess there was the famous LiveJournal architecture
article about MySQL. That was, I dunno, 2003?"

The person then told me the following history. I can neither
confirm nor deny it; what do you know about it?

I broke in. "Hey! In 1995 my brother and I were staff members at a Boy Scout
Camp, and one of the other staff members had a game called Ultima Underworld on
his PC. It was addictive. Any relationship?"

"Yes, it was a predecessor to Ultima Online."

"Oh," I said. "Well, that's basically the last game I've ever played.
But please go on."

True? False? It's easy to verify that the storyline is true, but is this how we
ended up with "sharding" in the database world, especially in MySQL?

Note: I'm paraphrasing the conversation from the cocktail party. My memory isn't
that good.
