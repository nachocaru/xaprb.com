I'm at [Hotsos Symposium][1] this week, and it suddenly occurred to me that a lot of Oracle DBAs who are beginning to manage MySQL servers might have some things to share with others in a similar role shift:

*   Familiar, comfortable tools and techniques, or capabilities of the Oracle Database, that you miss in MySQL
*   Equivalents or replacements for the aforementioned

Do you have anything to share with your fellow DBAs going through ODT (Oracle Delerium Tremens)? Do you have any wishes that you haven't satisfied yet? Post in the comments and let's see if we can create a sort of forum for sharing and/or a wishlist in case someone gets an urge to fill in a missing piece!
