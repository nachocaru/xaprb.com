Bug reports can be fun. They can also be terrible. Either way they can be entertaining. On the Drizzle IRC channel today I saw a couple references to MySQL bug reports: [it is stop working][1] and [Does not make toast][2] (which reminds me of the [Mozilla bug report about the kitchen sink][3]). Got any other favourites<sup>1</sup>?
