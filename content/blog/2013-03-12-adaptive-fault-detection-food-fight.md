I was a guest on the [Food Fight Show][1] last week, along with a bevy of really smart people asking and answering tough questions on fault detection. We didn't talk a lot about MySQL, but given that [VividCortex][2] is focusing on MySQL initially, pretty much all of my experience with zero-threshold, zero-configuration fault detection is MySQL-based.

It's a fun conversation with a lot of insights into the industry, what's wrong with current monitoring tools, and where monitoring is going. Also, it's sold out now, but [Monitorama][3] is a conference you might be interested in if you're doing monitoring (and who isn't?)
