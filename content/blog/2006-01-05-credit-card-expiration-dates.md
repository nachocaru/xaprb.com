    Yet another example of the problems caused by not using standardized date

My credit card says it expires &#8220;06/07&#8243;. What is that? Is it June 2007, or July 2006? You may think I&#8217;m being silly, but it confuses me. I&#8217;m not as smart as some people, but if it confuses me, it&#8217;s gonna confuse some others too.

I recently placed an order online and got the expiration date wrong. It wouldn&#8217;t have been all that bad if the entry form had mimicked exactly what&#8217;s on the front of my card, but the online form had a 4-digit year pulldown, followed by a two-digit space for the month &#8212; exactly the opposite order from my card. As a result, my card didn&#8217;t go through and the order became a big hassle. Yuck!

All this could have been avoided if the expiration date were specified as YYYY-MM. Is there a reason not to do this? Maybe the machines that stamp the cards would have to be replaced in order to change the dates, I don&#8217;t know. Regardless, it&#8217;s confusing for poor little me.

This won&#8217;t get any better until 2013, when two-digit years will be distinguishable from months. Alas.

Hey you credit card companies, why don&#8217;t you use ISO-8601 date formats?
