I&#8217;m scheduled to talk about Go a couple times in the upcoming weeks.

The first is May 4th in Arlington at [A Day Of Foster.ly][1]. I&#8217;ll be a participant in a panel titled *Add To Your Programming Toolkit: Languages You Should Know About (Erlang, Clojure, R, Go, etc&#8230;)*. I&#8217;m talking about Go, naturally.

The second May 7th is at my local technology guild, the [Neon Guild][2]. I&#8217;m going to be giving a &#8220;gentle introduction&#8221; to Go. I&#8217;ve been programming in Go for less than a year, so my first impressions are still fresh. If you are in the Charlottesville area and you haven&#8217;t been to a Neon Guild meeting, do yourself a favor and show up. It&#8217;s free and no RSVP is required. Description:

> It seems that every time I tell someone we&#8217;ve chosen Go as our primary language at VividCortex, they respond with something like &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard about Go! Neat! What is it like? Why did you choose it? Are you happy with it?&#8221; The answer is that Go is a fascinating language that&#8217;s working great for us. After many years of programming in everything from C to Java to C# to Perl to LISP to Shell, I&#8217;m pretty much in love with Go. There are particular reasons I chose it for our special use case, but beyond just niche considerations, it&#8217;s working great as a general-purpose, high-performance, very productive systems language. I&#8217;ll try to contain my enthusiasm and tell a story about evaluating it, learning it, and then learning it more deeply.
I hope to see you at one of these events. If you see me, wave and introduce yourself, and give me a business card so I can <s>stalk</s> connect with you on LinkedIn!
