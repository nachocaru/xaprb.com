For those of you who miss what [Maatkit][1]'s mk-audit tool (now retired) gave you, there's a pair of tools in [Aspersa][2] that more than replaces it. [I wrote previously about the summary tool][3]. I don't think I have mentioned the mysql-summary tool. It has been under development for a while, and at this point it has quite a lot of functionality. You can see a [sample of the output on its manual page][4].
