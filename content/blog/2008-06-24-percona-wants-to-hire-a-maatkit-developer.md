[Percona is looking to hire someone][1] to develop [Maatkit][2], among other things.

If I weren&#8217;t having so much fun being the consulting team lead, I&#8217;d be doing it myself. (In fact, I&#8217;m still hacking on it a lot. Got some pretty fun stuff done this weekend.) I don&#8217;t know what the rest of the world thinks, but I think Maatkit is a damn enjoyable project to work on. Hopefully someone else will have the same kind of mindset and want to get paid for it, unlike poor working-on-the-weekends me.

I&#8217;m not stepping away from the project. It&#8217;s just grown a lot, and there is room and money to grow it much more. This is actually the best compliment to the project: that it is worth hiring someone to keep improving it. Lots of people are using it, and there&#8217;s a lot of stealth-mode stuff I/we want to do with it too.

On a related note, who wants me to order another batch of Maatkit t-shirts? I&#8217;ve gotten quite a few questions about it.
