IE6, Firefox 1.5 and Opera 8.5 handle regular expressions slightly differently. I analyzed them and learned some interesting things about the browsers. For this article, I'm using `abcde` as the input, and `/abc|d(e)/g` as the regular expression. The expression should match twice, and the second match should capture the letter "e" because it's in a capturing subexpression.

### Properties of match results

Calling `RegExp.prototype.exec()` with a global regular expression returns an Array object with some extra properties. IE and Opera don't quite agree with [ECMA-262][1] &#8212; they add extra properties and don't create properties that should exist (Firefox gets it right).

In case you don't know the ins and outs of JavaScript regexes, there is a subtlety about capturing subexpressions and global regular expressions. `exec` actually only looks for one match even though the expression is global, but sets the index at which the match happened. If I call it again, it keeps looking from where it left off, so I can loop through the successive matches. Each time the result is an array containing the current match, plus the captures and information about where the match occurred. As usual, index 0 of the array contains the text of the entire match, index 1 contains the first captured subexpression, and so on.

Here's what I get when I call `/abc|d(e)/g.exec("abcde")` twice in a row on the browsers in question:

    <p>
      I got the results with a <code>for/in</code> loop, like so:
    </p>
    
    <pre>var re = /abc|d(e)/g;
var result = re.exec("abcde");
for (var prop in result) {
    ...</pre>
    
    <p>
      Here are the differences:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        Opera doesn't enumerate over the first captured subexpression in the first result. In Firefox, it exists without a value (has the special value <code>undefined</code>), and in IE it exists <strong>with a value</strong> &#8212; the empty string.
      </li>
      <li>
        IE adds the proprietary <code>lastIndex</code> property to the result.
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>
      Subexpressions
    </h3>
    
    <p>
      I said Opera <em>doesn't enumerate over</em> the property named "1&#8243; in the first result. According to the spec, the property named "1&#8243; should still exist. Opera knows the property should exist, as I proved by examining the <code>length</code> property. Its value is 2 in all browsers, which is correct as specified by section 15.10.6.2 of the spec:
    </p>
    
    <blockquote cite="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/Ecma-262.pdf">

        </li>
        <li value="12">
          Let <em>n</em> be the length of <em>r</em>'s <em>captures</em> array. (This is the same value as 15.10.2.1&#8242;s <em>NCapturingParens</em>.)

            </li>
            <li>
              The <strong><code>input</code></strong> property is set to <em>S</em>.
            </li>
            <li>
              The <strong><code>length</code></strong> property is set to <em>n</em> + 1.
            </li>
            <li>
              The <strong><code></code></strong> property is set to the matched substring (i.e. the portion of <em>S</em> between offset <em>i</em> inclusive and offset <em>e</em> exclusive).
            </li>
            <li>
              For each integer <em>i</em> such that <em>I</em> > 0 and <em>I</em> &#8804; <em>n</em>, set the property named ToString(<em>i</em>) to the <em>i</em><sup>th</sup> element of <em>r</em>'s <em>captures</em> array.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>
      In other words, the length of the array <em>should</em> be 2 even in the first match, because the length of the array depends <strong>only</strong> on the number of capturing subexpressions in the pattern &#8212; so the browsers are doing the right thing.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      If the property exists, Opera should enumerate it in the <code>for/in</code> loop. The spec is clear about what properties are enumerable (section 15.2.4.7), and it never says such a property should get the <code>dontEnum</code> attribute, so I think Opera's behavior is incorrect. In fact, I'm pretty sure Opera is actually never creating the property. I ran some tests with an Array and set one of the properties to <code>undefined</code>. Opera still enumerates it, so it's not as though Opera doesn't enumerate properties that have no value. I think Opera is setting <code>length</code> to 2, but never creating properties for capturing subexpressions that don't participate in the match. Technically this does not violate the spec's instructions on an Array's <code>length</code> property, but it is suspicious.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The moral of the story is you shouldn't use a <code>for/in</code> loop when iterating through subexpressions. Just iterate from 0 through <code>length</code> minus one.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I take exception to IE giving the capture a value. The subexpression doesn't capture anything and doesn't participate in the match, so it should not have a value &#8212; not even the empty string or <code>null</code>. I suppose this one is up for debate, but that's my personal opinion.
    </p>
    
    <h3>
      IE's <code>lastIndex</code> property
    </h3>
    
    <p>
      Technically, this property shouldn't be there; it should be a property of the global <code>RegExp</code> object in ECMA-262, or the regex itself in later versions of JavaScript (I have no idea why you'd make it a property of a global object; that seems like it would cause all sorts of stupid bugs, so I think the way IE does it is probably a lot smarter than the spec).
    </p>
    
    <h3>
      Other stuff
    </h3>
    
    <p>
      I spent a lot of time messing with the various browsers to see if I could find obscure bugs enumerating properties that don't exist, setting a value and then unsetting it on subsequent calls, and so forth. The good news is I didn't find any more bugs (though they could still exist!), and I found that the quasi-bugs discussed above are really trivial.
