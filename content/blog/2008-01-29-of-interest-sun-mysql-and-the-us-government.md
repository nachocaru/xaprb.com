Jason Hull of [OpenSource Connections][1], a company in my town, posted an article on [what Sun&#8217;s acquisition of MySQL means for the US government][2]. I thought Planet MySQL readers might appreciate a different angle on the issue than many of the Planet MySQL posts, which are often focused on business or community more than government.
