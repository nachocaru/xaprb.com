Jason Hull of [OpenSource Connections][1], a company in my town, posted an article on [what Sun's acquisition of MySQL means for the US government][2]. I thought Planet MySQL readers might appreciate a different angle on the issue than many of the Planet MySQL posts, which are often focused on business or community more than government. (I'm just passing the link along, not agreeing or disagreeing).
