I&#8217;ve just sent [an email to the Maatkit discussion list][1] to announce a planned change to how Maatkit (and Aspersa) are developed. In short, Percona plans to create a Percona Toolkit of MySQL-related utilities, as a fork of Maatkit and Aspersa. I&#8217;m very happy about this change, and I welcome your responses to that thread on the discussion list.
