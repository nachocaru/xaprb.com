Working at Percona has taught me to love being disruptive and creating innovative pricing models. In particular, their pay-as-you-go pricing in 15-minute increments, plus the ability to go from first contact to having them logged in and working in a few minutes with just a credit card, has been game-changing. I&#8217;ve always wanted to take that to the next level and create a new business, offering MySQL services with a radically simple pricing model.

Well, now I have. I&#8217;m offering the option to pay by the minute for MySQL consulting and support. And you don&#8217;t even need a credit card or approval from your boss. Best of all, I&#8217;ll talk geeky to you while I do it. Just call 1-900-SELECT and in no time at all, I&#8217;ll be fixing your servers while saying things like &#8220;I love the way you bash me with those shell scripts, you naughty boy! I&#8217;m gonna make you &#8216;friend class Baron&#8217; so you&#8217;ll have access to my protected variables!&#8221;

<em style="font-size:tiny">Note: this is a joke; if you call 1-900-SELECT, I have no idea who will pick up the phone, and I&#8217;m not responsible for any charges.</em>
