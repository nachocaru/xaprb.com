With the 3rd edition of [High Performance MySQL][1] finally complete, I've begun work on the 4th edition. As you know, technology moves much faster than printing presses, and a book is outdated very quickly, so this is a never-ending project. I'm also outlining the 5th edition in anticipation of starting it immediately afterwards.

I'm looking for your input on what I should cover in the new edition. Should I discuss MySQL's intra-query parallelization across multiple CPU cores? Should I explore how cloud computing platforms enable higher performance at lower cost than dedicated hardware? Should I explain the bizarre bug in MySQL's datetime type that causes it to skip the day after March 31st every year? What are your suggestions?
