This article shows you how to use a little-known InnoDB feature to find out what is holding the lock for which an InnoDB transaction is waiting. I then show you how to use an undocumented feature to make this even easier with [innotop][1].

### Background

One of the most common complaints I&#8217;ve heard from DBAs used to other database servers is &#8220;I can&#8217;t find out who holds the locks that are blocking all these connections and making them time out.&#8221; I feel your pain. Before I helped scale my employer&#8217;s systems to deal with larger volumes of data, InnoDB lock contention was a serious issue. And as far as I knew, you couldn&#8217;t find out who was holding locks. I knew you could see who was *waiting for locks to be granted*; that&#8217;s easy. You just run `SHOW INNODB STATUS` and look for the following text:

<pre>------------
TRANSACTIONS
------------
Trx id counter 0 4874
Purge done for trx's n:o &lt; 0 4869 undo n:o &lt; 0 0
History list length 21
Total number of lock structs in row lock hash table 2
LIST OF TRANSACTIONS FOR EACH SESSION:
---TRANSACTION 0 4873, ACTIVE 6 sec, process no 7142, OS thread id 1141152064 starting index read
mysql tables in use 1, locked 1
<strong>LOCK WAIT</strong> 2 lock struct(s), heap size 368
MySQL thread id 9, query id 173 localhost root Sending data
select * from t1 for update
------- <strong>TRX HAS BEEN WAITING 6 SEC FOR THIS LOCK TO BE GRANTED</strong>:
RECORD LOCKS space id 9 page no 3 n bits 72 index `PRIMARY` of table `test/t1` trx id 0 4873 lock_mode X waiting
...</pre>

That&#8217;s fine, but who holds the lock? I thought there was no way to find that out.

### InnoDB Lock Monitor

Until I learned about the <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/en/innodb-monitor.html">InnoDB Lock Monitor</a>, that is. You enable it by running the following command:

<pre>CREATE TABLE innodb_lock_monitor(a int) ENGINE=INNODB;</pre>

It&#8217;s quite an ugly hack, but it turns out the table name is actually &#8220;magical.&#8221; It&#8217;s a special table name that tells InnoDB to start the lock monitor. You can stop it by dropping the table again.

This little-noticed feature makes InnoDB print out a slightly modified version of what you see with `SHOW INNODB STATUS`. The &#8220;slight modification&#8221; is to print out not only the locks the transaction waits for, but also those it *holds*. For example, here&#8217;s the transaction that holds the locks:

<pre>---TRANSACTION 0 4872, ACTIVE 32 sec, process no 7142, OS thread id 1141287232
2 lock struct(s), heap size 368
MySQL thread id 8, query id 164 localhost root
<strong>TABLE LOCK table `test/t1` trx id 0 4872 lock mode IX
RECORD LOCKS space id 9 page no 3 n bits 72 index `PRIMARY` of table `test/t1` trx id 0 4872 lock_mode X</strong>
Record lock, heap no 1 PHYSICAL RECORD: n_fields 1; compact format; info bits 0
 0: len 8; hex 73757072656d756d; asc supremum;;

Record lock, heap no 2 PHYSICAL RECORD: n_fields 3; compact format; info bits 0
 0: len 4; hex 80000001; asc     ;; 1: len 6; hex 000000000d35; asc      5;; 2: len 7; hex 800000002d0110; asc     -  ;;</pre>

That&#8217;s fine, but there are, ah, limitations. As the manual says, InnoDB periodically prints out this text &#8212; essentially spewing InnoDB&#8217;s guts &#8212; to its standard output. This gets redirected to the server error log in any sane installation. Who&#8217;s looking there? And it gets printed out at long intervals, which seems to be about every 16 seconds on the machines I use.

Plus, if you&#8217;ve looked at the result, you&#8217;ll understand this is not something you want to search through manually looking for data. The output can be absolutely huge. What DBA wants to pore over thousands of hex-dumped rows from the table just to answer the question &#8220;who holds that lock?&#8221;

All in all, this is not very convenient (yep, I know that&#8217;s an understatement).

### Slightly more convenient

What&#8217;s a little more convenient than combing through all that text by hand is writing a program to parse InnoDB&#8217;s status output. You don&#8217;t have to, though. That&#8217;s what I wrote innotop to do. And I&#8217;ve just released version 1.5.2, which at long last has the ability to watch a log file as well as connecting to server(s).

Here&#8217;s how this works: you start innotop, and press the L key to switch to Lock mode. This replaces the old Lock Wait mode, which was only able to monitor the InnoDB lock waits you see in the normal output of `SHOW INNODB STATUS`.

This mode shows you something like the following:

<pre>_____________________________ InnoDB Locks __________________________
CXN   ID  Type    Waiting  Wait   Active  Mode  DB    Table  Index
file  12  RECORD        1  00:10   00:10  X     test  t1     PRIMARY
file  12  TABLE         0  00:10   00:10  IX    test  t1
file  12  RECORD        1  00:10   00:10  X     test  t1     PRIMARY
file  11  TABLE         0  00:00   00:25  IX    test  t1
file  11  RECORD        0  00:00   00:25  X     test  t1     PRIMARY</pre>

That&#8217;s helpful! I can see the locks held and waited for in a nice tabular format. It&#8217;s pretty easy to see connection 11 is blocking connection 12.

This is still pretty inconvenient, though. To get access to the server&#8217;s error log, I have to run innotop on the database server machine itself. Is there a better way?

### Even better

There is, in fact, but I discovered it completely by accident. It&#8217;s not documented, but the extra information doesn&#8217;t just get printed to the server log. It also shows up in `SHOW INNODB STATUS`! Now that&#8217;s a nice surprise. It means innotop can get lock information from a normal connection instead of monitoring a log file.

After discovering this, I immediately added some more features to innotop. There are now hot-keys in L mode to enable and disable the lock monitor. Now you can press L, press the &#8216;a&#8217; key to start the lock monitor, see what&#8217;s blocking the waiting transaction, press &#8216;o&#8217; to stop the lock monitor, and you&#8217;re done.

### Best yet

I&#8217;m sure you InnoDB administrators already recognize what an improvement this is over the options you previously had (essentially, you didn&#8217;t have any). There&#8217;s still a long way to go, though. Locks could be in the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` or in a `SHOW LOCKS` command. I won&#8217;t speculate on why they aren&#8217;t already.

Of course, the upcoming Falcon storage engine already has better features for debugging lock contention than this. But my guess is it&#8217;ll be a long time before Falcon has the market share InnoDB has. All things considered, InnoDB is a pretty nice piece of software.

The conclusion to this whole article is: use [innotop][1] if you use InnoDB. Heck, use it if you use MySQL at all. It makes a lot of things a lot easier, not just debugging InnoDB lock contention. Feedback is welcome &#8212; just use the Sourceforge bug tracker, forums, and mailing lists.
