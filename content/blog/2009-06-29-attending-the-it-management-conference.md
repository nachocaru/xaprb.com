I&#8217;ll be attending the [IT Management Conference][1] later this year in New York. My proposals weren&#8217;t chosen so I won&#8217;t be speaking, but I wanted to attend whether I&#8217;m speaking or not. It should be a very useful conference for those in or near management or leadership positions. Email me if you want a $50 discount off the registration, by the way.

*PS: .me is a new top-level domain? Ugh, when will it end.*
