Here is a collection of upcoming events that are interesting to me as a MySQL user (in some cases because I'm speaking). I think some of them are must-see events. I am sure I am missing a lot of events, but some of these are only publicized in specific channels, and I wanted to mention them here to help spread the word.

### Upcoming Meetups

This coming Thursday, Charlottesville's Neon Guild tech group will [co-host a Meetup with a noted Kanban expert][1].

I'm joining two Meetups soon to talk about building database (MySQL) applications with the Go programming language:

*   [Wednesday, March 13, 2013 in Charlottesville Virginia][2]
*   [Tuesday, March 19, 2013 in Alexandria, Virginia][3]

### Upcoming Conferences

*   [Percona Live MySQL Conference and Expo 2013][4] in Santa Clara, CA April 22-25, 2013. This is **the** annual MySQL conference. I'm not speaking this year, but&#8230;
*   [Velocity Web Performance And Operations Conference][5] June 18-20, Santa Clara, CA. This is an amazing event that brings together the best and brightest people who are building the future of the Internet. I am speaking on [quantifying system normality][6].

### Upcoming Call For Proposals

*   [OmniTI Surge, Maryland, Sep 12-13][7]. CfP closes May 1st.
*   [Velocity New York 2013 Call for Participation][8] (Oct 14-16). Proposals Due Apr 29th.
