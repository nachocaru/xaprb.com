Here's a quick productivity tip: when optimizing queries by rewriting them to different forms that should return the same results, you can verify that you get the same results by taking a checksum of them.

Just set your pager to `md5sum`:

<pre>mysql&gt; <strong>pager md5sum -</strong>
PAGER set to 'md5sum -'
mysql&gt; select * from test;
<strong>a09bc56ac9aa0cbcc659c3d566c2c7e4  -</strong>
4096 rows in set (0.00 sec)
</pre>
