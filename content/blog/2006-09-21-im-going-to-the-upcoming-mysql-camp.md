title: "I'm going to the upcoming MySQL Camp"

  <p>I've bought plane tickets to the upcoming <a href="http://mysqlcamp.org/">MySQL Camp</a> in November.  This is looking like a very fun time, with lots of community members, MySQL employees, and Google developers attending.  It's an "un-conference," which means there is no set schedule, and it's up to us to make out of the event whatever we wish it to be.  If you've been reading my articles or using my tools, is there anything you'd like me to present on?  I'd be happy to do it.</p>

I've bought plane tickets to the upcoming [MySQL Camp][1] in November. This is looking like a very fun time, with lots of community members, MySQL employees, and Google developers attending. It's an "un-conference," which means there is no set schedule, and it's up to us to make out of the event whatever we wish it to be. If you've been reading my articles or using my tools, is there anything you'd like me to present on? I'd be happy to do it.

I don't have a very good feel for what people use [innotop][2] for, for example; I see it's been downloaded a fair amount, but I don't know who's using it or what for. And I don't have a huge amount of feedback on what features are useful, useless, confusing, and so on. I could put a demo together if you want.

Any other thoughts? Write them into the comments! And as the topic for #mysql says, go or be destroyed! I'm really looking forward to meeting many of you for the first time. I hope to see you there.
