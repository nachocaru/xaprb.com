I&#8217;ll speak at the [Shenandoah Ruby Users Group][1] meeting next week in Harrisonburg, Virgina. I&#8217;m preparing a brand-new talk for this, called &#8220;Seven Things To Know About MySQL Performance.&#8221; Hopefully my copies of the new [High Performance MySQL, 3rd Edition][2] will have arrived by then and I can give one away!

The meetup is free and friendly. If you&#8217;re in the area, you oughta be there!
