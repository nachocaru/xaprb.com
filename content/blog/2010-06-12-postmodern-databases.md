[Dr. Richard Hipp][1] gave a talk at [Southeast Linux Fest][2] today on choosing an open-source database. He thinks that NoSQL is not a very good name for the new databases we&#8217;re seeing these days, so he proposed a new name: postmodern databases. Why postmodern?

*   The absence of objective truth
*   Queries return opinions, not facts

I thought this was the best proposal I&#8217;ve heard for an alternative to the NoSQL moniker. And this is not bashing &#8212; the absence of objective truth can actually be an enabling quality, not necessarily a drawback. There&#8217;s a lot to compliment about the new databases, and calling them NoSQL is really a disservice &#8212; like calling a car a horseless carriage.
