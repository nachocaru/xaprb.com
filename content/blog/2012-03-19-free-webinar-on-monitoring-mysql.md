If you follow what Percona is up to, you might have noticed that I've created a set of high-quality monitoring and graphing plugins for MySQL and related systems. Currently they support Nagios and Cacti. I'll give a [free webinar on March 28th][1] discussing these, and more broadly, discussing how to monitor MySQL successfully to avoid common problems like spammy alerts about nonexistent problems.
