I clicked around for a few moments but didn't immediately see a license mentioned for the MariaDB knowledgebase. As far as I know, the MySQL documentation is not licensed in a way that would allow copying or derivative works, but at least some of the MariaDB Knowledge Base seems to be pretty similar to the corresponding MySQL documentation. See for example LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE: [MariaDB][1], [MySQL][2]. 

Oracle's MySQL documentation has a licensing [notice][3] that states: 

> You may create a printed copy of this documentation solely for your own personal use. Conversion to other formats is allowed as long as the actual content is not altered or edited in any way. You shall not publish or distribute this documentation in any form or on any media, except if you distribute the documentation in a manner similar to how Oracle disseminates it (that is, electronically for download on a Web site with the software) or on a CD-ROM or similar medium, provided however that the documentation is disseminated together with the software on the same medium. Any other use, such as any dissemination of printed copies or use of this documentation, in whole or in part, in another publication, requires the prior written consent from an authorized representative of Oracle. Oracle and/or its affiliates reserve any and all rights to this documentation not expressly granted above.

Can someone clarify the situation?
