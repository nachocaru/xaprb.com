I've been considering using TokuDB for a large dataset, primarily because of its high compression. The data is append-only, never updated, rarely read, and purged after a configurable time. 

I use partitions to drop old data a day at a time. It's much more efficient than deleting rows, and it lets me avoid indexing the data on the time dimension. Partitioning serves as a crude form of indexing, as well as helping purge old data. 

I wondered if TokuDB supports partitioning. Then I remembered some older posts from the Tokutek blog about partitioning. The [claim][1] is that "there are almost always better (higher performing, more robust, lower maintenance) alternatives to partitioning." 

I'm not sure this is true for my use case, for a couple of reasons. 

First, I clearly fall into the only category that the flowchart acknowledges may be a good use case for partitioning: I do need instant block deletes. Paying for data ingestion as well as purging doesn't make sense in my case. It's like eating a hot hot curry -- I don't want to feel the pain on the way out too :-)

Secondly, data size matters a lot. If I need to create a redundant index on the timestamp dimension, no matter how good TokuDB's compression is, it'll inflate my storage and I/O costs. And make my backups bigger, and so on, and so on. I don't want an index that I don't need. My queries operate very efficiently without the timestamp index, and creating one only to help delete older data fast wouldn't make sense. 

In the end I got sidetracked and decided to write this blog post. And I didn't find out whether TokuDB supports partitioning or not! Silly me.
