It has all played itself out according to Microsoft's wishes. They have railroaded through a [so-called standard for document representation][1], gotten it rubber-stamped by so-called standards bodies, and fought their way past all the [objections of sensible people and companies][2]. In the process, lots of [developing nations have been steamrolled][3], too. Shame, shame, shame.
