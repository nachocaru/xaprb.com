I wrote a post recently that focused only on things I see as shortcomings or problems with Gentoo GNU/Linux. That was the intent of the article, to explain why I switched to Ubuntu for my personal systems. On the flip side, nothing's perfect, but nothing's perfectly flawed, either. There are still many things I like about Gentoo.

For one thing, the developer and user community are great (I have written about this several times before). Two developers took the time to reply to my article, and the bug I filed on MySQL is fixed now. Gentoo has great people behind it, and I really appreciate it.

There are also many things you can do with a Gentoo system you can't do with most (any?) other systems. Portage is a great tool. You can learn about how things really work with Gentoo. You can use it as a meta-distribution to build a custom binary distribution. It's really a blank slate. That's part of the point.

So, while I continue to enjoy the easy installation and low maintenance of Ubuntu on my desktop computers, I don't want to leave my appreciation for Gentoo, especially the Gentoo people, unsaid. Thanks.
