Ever seen this in `SHOW INNODB STATUS` and wondered what it means?

`<pre>
-------------------------------------
INSERT BUFFER AND ADAPTIVE HASH INDEX
-------------------------------------
Ibuf: size 1, free list len 4634, seg size 4636,
</pre>` 
I&#8217;ve never been quite sure, and [Peter didn&#8217;t really clarify things][1] himself, so I took a look at the source. If I&#8217;m not mistaken, the seg size is really one more than the number of records the insert buffer can hold, the free list length is the number that aren&#8217;t in use, and the size is just `seg_size - (1 + free_list_len)`. These seem to be kept in lockstep as records are inserted and merged.
