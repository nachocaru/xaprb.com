Are you a Django user? There&#8217;s an [upcoming Django conference in Chicago in a few months][1], and I know they&#8217;re looking for speakers with MySQL experience in particular. One suggestion the organizers have floated is a talk on MySQL:

> I&#8217;m looking for someone to give at least one MySQL talk there. In particular, I would love a (friendly but vigorous) &#8220;Why you should use MySQL instead of PostgreSQL talk&#8221;, as PostgreSQL tends to get a lot of love and attention at Django events, and MySQL not so much.
Take a look at it and see if you are interested. Presenting at a conference is one of the best things you can do for your career, your company, and your community of open-source software. I highly encourage it if you haven&#8217;t tried it.
