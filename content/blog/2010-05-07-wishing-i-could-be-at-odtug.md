[Ronald][1] asked me if I could present at [ODTUG's Kaleidoscope conference][2], which is only a couple hours from me, but I'll be at the [Netways OSDC][3] that week. Matt Yonkovit will be there representing Percona. I wish I could go: I would really like to mingle with more Oracle users and developers, and I think that participation is the key to building relationships between MySQL and Oracle users &#8212; two groups of people who are going to be overlapping more in the future. If you can attend, I hope you will &#8212; and blog about it so I can read.
