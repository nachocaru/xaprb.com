The book is done now, right? What's next?

Don't tell my wife this, but a book is never done.

Right now I'm proofreading the printed copy. I proofread PDF after PDF during production, but some problems will always slip through and make it to paper. I'm finding quite a few little mistakes. For example, at one point we refer to [TPC][1] as TCP three times in a row. Oops.

These problems will be corrected in the next printing. Please notify me if you find any errors yourself, and I'll add them to the list of things to fix! Also let me know if you find things that should just be "fixed" in general. For example, the layout and page-breaking on pages 364 and 365 is totally confusing -- it's hard to tell which figures are associated with which text.

I'm not offering rewards like Donald Knuth, sorry&#8230;

I will place a list of errata on the official [High Performance MySQL Second Edition][2] website, including a non-mangled Figure 8-12. (Another thing that didn't make it through production unscathed.)
