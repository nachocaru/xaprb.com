  I'll be attending the <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/mysql2008/">2008 MySQL Conference and Expo</a> again this year, and I'm looking forward to hearing some great sessions, meeting new and old friends, and giving sessions myself.  As a proposal reviewer, I looked at and voted on 250+ proposals for sessions and tutorials for this conference.  There are going to be some great sessions and tutorials.</p>

As a proposal reviewer, I looked at and voted on 250+ proposals for sessions and tutorials for this conference. There are going to be some great sessions and tutorials.<sup>[1]</sup>

If you haven&#8217;t come to the conference previously, it&#8217;s well worth your time and money, in my opinion.

I (Baron Schwartz) am giving [two sessions][2] myself, on extremely practical topics. One is the [query cache][3], and the other is [EXPLAIN][4]. Both are the subject of many myths and misunderstandings! My goal is to remove all the programmer-speak and show you how they really work. Once you understand that, you can understand the technical terminology. (But it&#8217;s very hard to go the other direction).

I haven&#8217;t decided yet which sessions I want to attend, but I know this: I&#8217;m not going to miss seeing how [Beat Vontobel solves a Su Doku puzzle with only self-joins][5]. His session on views last year was just amazing.

Hopefully there&#8217;ll be plenty of time to sit down for meals and chats with all the people I correspond with throughout the year, but rarely get to see or talk to!

<sup>1</sup>And no, I don&#8217;t get any kickback for saying nice things about the conference. Even reviewing all those proposals was a volunteer job. And Jay Pipes tricked me into it, the rat! He told me it would be only a few hours. Haha, you can&#8217;t review 250 proposals in a few hours&#8230; I have to say though, some of them were really rewarding to read. One of them was about holding a cosmic prayer circle or something like that. Without expressing any opinion on my religion/spirituality, I did have to vote NO on that one &#8212; sorry, wrong conference.
