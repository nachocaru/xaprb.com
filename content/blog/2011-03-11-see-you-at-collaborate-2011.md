I'll be speaking at [IOUG's Collaborate][1] conference in Florida the week of April 10-14. My session is called [MySQL Performance Basics][2]. For those who know MySQL, this won't be exciting, but if you're new to it, I hope it will be a good orientation to what you should focus on and ignore.

Sheeri Cabral posted a good round-up of [the MySQL talks at Collaborate][3] on the PalominoDB blog.
