If you have to prioritize projects (and you do), you are sacrificing one thing for another. What happens when that starts to work against itself? What happens when you can&#8217;t just put the highest priority project on top? Can you imagine your priorities looking like this?

I see this happen all the time. That&#8217;s not to say priorities are evil in and of themselves. I&#8217;m just pointing out that at some point priorities will conflict. This affects many things, but most importantly it affects everyone&#8217;s morale, including the customer&#8217;s. This is a project risk like any other.

My current employment is at a modified XP shop, and I&#8217;m really psyched about it. I&#8217;m a big fan of [XP][1], Agile and Scrum methodologies &#8212; and a big fan of Scott Ambler, too. I have always been risk-focused when managing software projects. Right now I&#8217;m not managing any, but I appreciate the XP approach because of its focus on mitigating risk by dealing with it (possible) instead of trying to eliminate it (impossible).

This is the first job I&#8217;ve had in a long time where I&#8217;ve been this excited about getting right into it and building something great in a small team of smart people. I feel like I&#8217;ve got a Maserati and an empty road. At my previous job, there was an entry on the timesheet for time spent filling out the timesheet. Here&#8217;s a quote from my present boss:

> If tracking time becomes something we have to become aware of, then we have a problem.

I think it&#8217;s going to be a very good journey.
