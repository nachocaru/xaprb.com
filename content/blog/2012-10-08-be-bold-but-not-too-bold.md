Someone&#8217;s testing my blog recently, trying by hand to get comments through my spam blockers. They&#8217;re trying by hand because automated attempts are blocked and the server simply doesn&#8217;t respond. Hand-submitting spam doesn&#8217;t scale, so only a few have popped up on my admin screen.

Have fun, I.P. addresses 173.213.212.234 and 219.91.208.244 (remember the Internet isn&#8217;t anonymous). If you look around this blog you won&#8217;t notice any spam comments. There&#8217;s a reason for that &#8212; a combination of reasons, actually. You&#8217;re unlikely to defeat the measures I&#8217;ve put in place, unless you try things that most people would consider hacking. And if you do that, be prepared for the consequences.

Of course, if you&#8217;re actually trying to leave a comment, just do it. All appropriate comments are approved, although sometimes it takes me a few hours to moderate them.
