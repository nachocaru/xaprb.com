I've noticed that a steady and perhaps even growing number of bug reports and feature requests are getting resolved for the next milestone release. I continue to see signs that Oracle's next release of MySQL will not only include much of the unreleased good work that's been done over the last few years, but will add a lot of new features and fixes as well.
