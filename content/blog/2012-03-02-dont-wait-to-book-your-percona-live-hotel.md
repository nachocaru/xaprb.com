If you haven't booked your [hotel room][1] yet, you should do it ASAP. The hotel is going to raise their rates at the same time the early-bird conference rate expires. This is a coincidence: **Percona has no control over hotel prices.** (There is a group discount rate, but we don't call the shots on that.)

A good rule of thumb is that if you're thinking about traveling somewhere, you should book your hotel immediately, and cancel if you change your mind. You can save a lot of money on booking the hotel early, and hotels allow cancellations without a charge. So there is no downside and a lot of potential upside! Sometimes I book several hotels and then cancel all but one of them.

With regard to this event, I have always found that staying in the hotel (as opposed to a nearby hotel) increases the value a lot. Traveling back and forth eats into networking opportunities a lot. So, if you want to stay in the official hotel, my advice is **book now, decide later**.
