Tomorrow is the first of [five days I will spend working on `mk-table-sync`][1], the data synchronization tool I developed as part of [Maatkit][2]. The first thing I'll do is pull the row-checksumming code out into a module and write a unit test suite for it. I'll probably add the code to the module that does checksums for `mk-table-checksum`, since it is not all that different.

My mind is not fresh on the code, but I think the next thing after that will be to pull out the code that finds differences in two sets of rows. It is largely identical for the two algorithms (which I called top-down and bottom-up for lack of better ideas). My plan is to use a callback function to abstract away the functionality that's not the same. In other words, I'll write code that accepts two sets of rows and a reference to a subroutine, and when it finds a difference between the rows it will call the subroutine.

This is a bit speculative, but the next step after that is probably to write modules for the top-down and bottom-up code too.

Then the rest of the program becomes "glue" for these tested modules. A lot of the functionality is already in modules I built for other tools, such as the code that parses a table definition, finds an optimal index, etc. I'm not sure how much of the code I've already written (and tested) will be able to replace parts of the current non-modular script, but I think it'll be a lot. And I'll just have to see what's left over and how much of that fits into yet more modules. With yet more test suites.

The features I'm planning to implement, as well as the bugs I'm planning to fix, are all in the bug tracker at Sourceforge.
