As you may have noticed, [Calpont][1] [has been][2] [advertising themselves][3] as an open-source storage engine for MySQL. And yet there is no source code.

A bit of back-story. When we were choosing speakers for the [Percona Performance Conference][4], I personally reviewed Calpont's submission and sent them an email on March 19th:

> I cannot confirm that this is an open-source columnar storage engine. I can't find source code or a download of the software. Can you point me the right direction on that? I want to be sure we are describing things accurately.

The response was

> Calpont is indeed going to be placed into the open source community somewhere right around the time of the User Conference. We are in the process of wrapping up a few things before we make it available for download so that we can make sure that we make the right first impression."

I accepted their talk on good faith, but I still don't see any source code, just "How to Buy" buttons. This blog post is a gentle public reminder that the source code is overdue.
