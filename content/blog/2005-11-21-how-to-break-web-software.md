I recently did a technical review of [*How to Break Web Software: Functional and Security Testing of Web Applications and Web Services*][1], by [James A. Whittaker][2] and [Mike Andrews][3]. My thoughts: it&#8217;s well worth reading.

Though what I reviewed wasn&#8217;t yet a final draft (my job was to help find technical and other errors, make suggestions on organizing the information and so forth), the content was (mostly) all there. I own other work by Whittaker, and I encourage anyone who&#8217;s interested to read this book when it&#8217;s published. It is appropriate for a variety of audiences. I will not recommend anything to anyone &#8212; I don&#8217;t want to be in the position of giving advice, for several reasons &#8212; but allow me to &#8220;suggest that you consider owning a copy&#8221; if you make things people will view with a web browser. Here&#8217;s a sampling of folks for whom I consider this book especially relevant:

*   a tester
*   a programmer
*   a team leader or manager
*   a creative copywriter

Security is everyone&#8217;s job, and basic understanding of how security can be violated will change the way you think. It&#8217;s a good thing.

I am not paid for this veiled endorsement. It is unsolicited, but approved by the authors :^).
