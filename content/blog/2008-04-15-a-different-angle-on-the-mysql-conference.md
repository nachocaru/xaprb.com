There are quite a few business angles you might see only if you&#8217;re here at the conference, and you won&#8217;t get from blogs. For example, let&#8217;s take a look at the contents of the shoulder bags they hand out with your registration. (This is only a partial list.)

*   SnapLogic&#8217;s flyer gets it right: their system is compatible with &#8220;GNU Linux.&#8221; Hooray, a commercial company acknowledging the GNU operating system for what it is!
*   MySQL Enterprise&#8217;s flyer has three big bullet points: MySQL Load Balancer, MySQL Connection Manager, and MySQL Enterprise Monitor Query Analyzer. The first two look like they&#8217;re probably built on MySQL Proxy. The last has a visual explain plan feature, which according to an elevator conversation is not yet built. I&#8217;ll stop by their booth and see. As you may know, [Maatkit][1] has provided a tool (which is designed for integration into other tools) that shows a visual explain plan for a long time.
*   There&#8217;s an issue of Linux Journal, which does *not* get the GNU part right. And it has no articles about MySQL. Off-topic! Discarded!
*   Infobright&#8217;s flyer says they can load data nearly real-time. I don&#8217;t know how you read it, but to me that says &#8220;can&#8217;t quite keep up with how fast you generate data.&#8221; So&#8230; what good can it possibly be, right?
*   The conference bag itself has Zmanda&#8217;s logo on the side.
*   Webyog&#8217;s flyer has one side for SQLyog, and one for MONyog. Each side takes the sparse but visually appealing approach of shiny icons to present a feature list. My favorite is the &#8220;Find slow SQL&#8221; turtle.
*   JasperSoft&#8217;s flyer has soothing, professional blues and rich reds. It makes them look very trustworthy. (I&#8217;m not being snarky.) And they have lots of nice whitespace. It&#8217;s a little bit of a different look.
*   Kickfire&#8217;s marketing department is really on the ball. I&#8217;ve seen a large number of flyers and other materials from them (online and offline) and they just changed their name and created a new logo and look-and-feel a short time ago. How do they do it so fast?
*   O&#8217;Reilly has a bunch of half-sized flyers for their conferences. We should have asked them to throw in one about our upcoming book, the second edition of [High Performance MySQL][2]. Alas, opportunity lost. By the way, stop by the bookstore and grab a copy of the sample chapter.
*   Zmanda, not content with stamping the outside of the bag, has a half-flyer inside it too, plus a chance to win a Digital Rebel to lure you to their booth. If you&#8217;re doing backups the way a lot of people seem to, you might want to stop by their booth anyway&#8230;
*   There&#8217;s a CD for a free trial of WinSQL. But the CD case doesn&#8217;t say what the

Sorry. I have a short attention span.
