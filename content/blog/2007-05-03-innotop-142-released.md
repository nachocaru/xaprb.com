This release of the innotop MySQL and InnoDB monitor is a major upgrade in terms of functionality, code quality, and interface consistency. It is the result of me working for over a month to get innotop into shape for the recent MySQL Conference and Expo. Here's a summary of the changes:

### Major changes

*   Quick-filters to easily filter any column in any display
*   Compatibility with MySQL 3.23 through 6.0
*   Improved error handling when a server is down, permissions denied, etc
*   Use additional SHOW INNODB STATUS information in 5.1.x
*   Make all modes use tables consistently, so they can all be edited, filtered, colored and sorted consistently
*   Combine V, G and S modes into S mode, with v, g, and s hot-keys
*   Let DBD driver read MySQL option files; permit connections without user/pass/etc 
    *   Compile SQL-like expressions into Perl subroutines; eliminate need to know Perl 
        *   Do not save all config data to config file, only save user's customizations
        *   Rewritten and improved command-line option handling
        *   Added &#8211;count, &#8211;delay, and other command-line options to support run-and-exit operation 
            *   Improve built-in variable sets
            *   Improve help screen with three-part balanced-column layout
            *   Simplify table-editor and improve hotkey support
            *   Require Perl to have high-resolution time support (Time::HiRes)
            *   Help the user choose a query to analyze or kill
            *   Enable EXPLAIN, show-full-query in T mode just like Q mode
            *   Let data-extraction access current, previous and incremental data sets all at once </ul> 
                ### Minor changes
                
                *   Column stabilizing for Q mode
                *   New color rules for T, Q, W modes
                *   Apply slave I/O filter to Q mode
                *   Improve detection of server version and other meta-data
                *   Make connection timeout a config variable
                *   Improve cross-version-compatible SQL syntax
                *   Get some information from the DBD driver instead of asking MySQL for it
                *   Improved error messages
                *   Improve server group creation/editing
                *   Improve connection/thread killing
                *   Fix broken key bindings and restore previously mapped hot-keys for choosing columns
                *   Some documentation updates (but not nearly enough)
                *   Allow the user to specify graphing char in S mode (formerly G mode)
                *   Allow easy switching between variable sets in S mode
                *   Bind 'n' key globally to choose the 'next' server connection
                *   Bind '%' key globally to filter displayed tables
                *   Allow aligning columns on the decimal place for easy readability
                *   Add hide_hdr config variable to hide column headers in tables
                *   Add a feature to smartly run PURGE MASTER LOGS in Replication mode
                *   Enable debug mode as a globally configurable variable
                *   Improve error messages when an expression or filter doesn't compile or has a run-time error; die on error when debug is enabled
                *   Allow user-configurable delays after executing SQL (to let the server settle down before taking another measurement)
                *   Add an expression to show how long until a transaction is finished
                *   Add skip_innodb as a global config variable
                *   Add '%' after percentages to help disambiguate (user-configurable)
                *   Add column to M mode to help see how fast slave is catching up to master
                ### Bug fixes
                
                *   T and W modes had wrong value for wait_status column
                *   Error tracking on connections didn't reset when the connection recovered
                *   wait_timeout on connections couldn't be set before MySQL 4.0.3
                *   There was a crash on 3.23 when wiping deadlocks
                *   Lettercase changes in some result sets (SHOW MASTER/SLAVE STATUS) between MySQL versions crashed innotop
                *   Inactive connections crashed innotop upon access to DBD driver
                *   set_precision did not respect user defaults for number of digits
                *   &#8211;inc command-line option could not be negated
                *   InnoDB status parsing was not always parsing all needed information
                *   S mode (formerly G mode) could crash trying to divide non-numeric data
                *   M table didn't show Slave\_open\_temp_tables variable; incorrect lettercase
                *   DBD drivers with broken AutoCommit would crash innotop
                *   Some key bindings had incorrect labels
                *   Some config-file loading routines could load data for things that didn't exist
                *   Headers printed too often in S mode
                *   High-resolution time was not used even when the user had it
                *   Non-interactive mode printed blank lines sometimes
                *   Q-mode header and statusbar showed different QPS numbers
                *   Formulas for key-cache and query-cache hit ratios were wrong
                *   Mac OS "Darwin" machines were mis-identified as Microsoft Windows
                *   Some multiplications crashed when given undefined input
                *   The commify transformation did not check its input and could crash
                *   Specifying an invalid mode on the command line or config file could crash innotop
                ### What's next
                
                In a word: documentation.
                
                But that's not all. Take a look at the roadmap for the project, and you find such features as mutex monitoring, the ability to monitor a file instead of connecting to a MySQL server, and much more. Some of this functionality is already done, but it's not mature enough to release (feel free to use the latest trunk source, which is what I use every day; it usually works just fine).
