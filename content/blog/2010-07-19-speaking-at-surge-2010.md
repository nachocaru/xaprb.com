The CfP just closed, so the list of speakers is still growing, but it already includes impressive names such as Neil J. Gunther. So far, this speaker list has zero fluff, and reminds me of the [Percona Performance Conference][3]. I&#8217;ll be talking about how not to shard your systems. Sharding is no fun and it&#8217;s costly. If you don&#8217;t have to do it &#8212; and many applications don&#8217;t need to, with orders-of-magnitude performance improvements in MySQL &#8212; you should not.
