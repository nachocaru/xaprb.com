If you&#8217;re waiting for [High Performance MySQL Second Edition][1] to hit the shelf, you&#8217;re not the only one. I am too! I can&#8217;t wait to actually hold it in my hands.

But you don&#8217;t have to wait idly. No, not at all! You can [pre-order][1] it and then you&#8217;ll get it as soon as possible. Plus your pre-order will help them figure out how much demand there is, so it doesn&#8217;t sell out and make you wait for your own copy.
