If you're waiting for [High Performance MySQL Second Edition][1] to hit the shelf, you're not the only one. I am too! I can't wait to actually hold it in my hands.

But you don't have to wait idly. No, not at all! You can [pre-order][1] it and then you'll get it as soon as possible. Plus your pre-order will help them figure out how much demand there is, so it doesn't sell out and make you wait for your own copy.
