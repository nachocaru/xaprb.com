      <p>A couple of months ago I bent the ear of a friend whose opinion I really respect. She&rsquo;s a totally sharp engineer who actively writes code for a living as well as managing large teams. She&rsquo;s held top-level technical roles at some large and extremely respectable companies. In short, her perspective and experience is very valuable.</p>

<p>One of my most important questions was what technologies she saw as established or emerging winners &ndash; good technologies to use as the foundation for a <a href="http://vividcortex.com">startup</a>. I had a list of requirements I needed my technologies to meet, but I wanted to know what other requirements she thought would be important to consider. For example, the ability to hire engineers to work with the technologies.</p>

<p>My prime candidate for a main programming language was Go, and I was also considering Java, Scala, Clojure, and C/C++. Most languages were easy to eliminate based on my requirements. I tried to summarize my reasons for Go and against others, and asked what she thought.</p>

<p>Her response was that Go was probably not a good choice. As she pointed out, one could make the case that it&rsquo;s immature and unproven, and it&rsquo;s not clear whether it&rsquo;s gaining significant mindshare. It&rsquo;s probably hard to find people who know it, and risky and costly to hire people and then train them in it. She recommended that I consider Java and C++ at the top of my list, because they are safer options for many of the reasons Go would be risky. She also recommended that I consider &ldquo;cool&rdquo; languages and environments in order to attract great talent. She put JavaScript and Node.JS onto my list of things to evaluate.</p>

<p>In the weeks that followed, I did a lot of hard thinking, and also sought the advice of many other people. In the end, I chose Go as a main language, and so far I don&rsquo;t see a reason to change that decision.</p>

<p>Why would I choose Go when so many factors seemingly weigh against it? Partly because it&rsquo;s easier to meet many of my specific requirements in Go than it is in other languages. Meeting these requirements gives a lot of business benefits (significantly lowering the barrier to customer adoption, for example).</p>

<p>So regardless of the negatives, the positives for Go for my specific use case are very strong.</p>

<p>In addition, the usual benefits discussed about Go are turning out to be very true in my experience. You can read some articles or watch some talks on <a href="http://golang.org/">golang.org</a> to see what those benefits are. It&rsquo;s not hype; Go really is that good. Check out this great <a href="http://vimeo.com/53221560">talk</a>.</p>

<p>The real reason I chose Go, though, is that I took it for a test drive and found out for myself. Not just reading about it or doing code tours and walk-throughs &ndash; building systems with it. I decided to reimplement my most recent Perl program in Go and see how it went. The program does <a href="http://www.xaprb.com/blog/2012/10/02/adaptive-fault-detection-in-mysql-servers/">adaptive fault detection</a> on time-series data at a fine resolution. It takes 1m16s to run on a sample dataset I use a lot. After rewriting it clumsily in Go, it runs in a few seconds. Keep in mind that I&rsquo;m not a novice Perl programmer, and I don&rsquo;t think my Perl program could be made much faster. This is an illustration of the execution speed difference between a scripting language and a compiled language.</p>

<p>That was a nice validation, but I wasn&rsquo;t close to being ready to decide on Go. I spent a few weeks implementing throwaway prototypes for risky or uncertain parts of my planned system in Go, as well as writing portions of things that I knew would be humdrum turn-the-crank code. Along the way I learned a bit about designing to Go&rsquo;s strengths, and started to become a little bit more productive (I am not as fast a learner as many of the people who say they&rsquo;ve learned Go in a couple of weeks). I probed into things like how robust its support for MySQL client libraries is, and how easy it is to work with C or C++ libraries in case something doesn&rsquo;t exist in Go but does in a C library.</p>

<p>I also dug a lot into the community: the mailing list, the blogs, the projects that companies build in Go. It turns out there&rsquo;s a lot more adoption of Go than I thought at first. There are many major systems written with it, some of them at hot up-and-coming companies, some at older companies. It&rsquo;s not just Google.</p>

<p>In the end, I still really appreciate the advice from my friend. It was good advice and pointed out a number of things I needed to think about more or investigate further. But you have to make your own decisions, not just follow advice. And that&rsquo;s the difference between asking a friend for an opinion, and asking a friend to decide for you.</p>
