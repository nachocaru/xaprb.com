      <p>How do you connect to and converse with your database of choice (MySQL, in my case)? Chances are it&rsquo;s largely formed by the programming language you choose. I&rsquo;ve worked with a variety of programming languages. Anytime I begin learning a new one, I am reminded again that there&rsquo;s more than one way to skin a cat.</p>

<p>Over the last few years, I&rsquo;ve mostly programmed in Perl and shell. The shell interface to MySQL is simple: the <code>mysql</code> command-line tool. There is not much to think about. In Perl, however, the standard is to use DBI. I have grown accustomed to DBI over the years, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean I like it. I think it&rsquo;s one of the worst database APIs I&rsquo;ve seen. The abstractions it uses (there are only two object abstractions: connections and &ldquo;statement handles&rdquo;) are awkward to the extreme.</p>

<p>It does get worse, though. PHP historically used libmysql&rsquo;s C library for connecting to MySQL, and similarly used native drivers/libraries for every other database. You had no notion of abstraction: you called the library&rsquo;s functions directly. Sure, there were PEAR libraries to wrap around this, but a) they were ugly too, and not really a PHP standard, and b) the language could have done us all a favor and defined a common interface that all of the drivers could be wrapped inside. That&rsquo;s what every other language tends to do, love it or hate it. When I wrote a lot of PHP, and this was before the newer drivers were available, I wrote a set of classes to abstract away from the raw libmysql C function calls.</p>

<p>Guess what design I chose to emulate for that? Microsoft&rsquo;s. Microsoft&rsquo;s database interaction libraries make a lot of sense for me. There&rsquo;s a notion of a Connection. You can create a Statement that&rsquo;s tied to the connection, and when you execute the Statement, you get a Result, and so on. This is fairly consistent for VBScript (ASP), Visual Basic, the .NET class libraries, and so on. It is a clean and straightforward design. The functions you want to execute map to verbs you think about, and the nouns/objects are also obvious. You execute a Statement to get a Result.</p>

<p>Think about that in contrast to Perl, where you prepare a Statement against a Database (not a Connection?) and then execute a Statement ($sth) to get&hellip; nothing but an indication of whether it succeeded, and then you start retrieving rows from&hellip; the $sth? Huh? But rows don&rsquo;t belong to a Statement, they belong to a Result! Oh, I get it, after I execute a Statement, it shape-shifts into a Result. And then I can re-execute it&hellip; bleh. All of the nouns are overloaded with several meanings because there aren&rsquo;t enough nouns to represent the variety of concepts, and the verbs are attached to the wrong nouns, and it&rsquo;s just ugly.</p>

<p>Funny enough, I never wrote a sane interface around DBI. (It&rsquo;s already a wrapper anyway.) I just dealt with it. But I never liked it, and somehow I must have been like the frog in the teapot and never jumped out.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m learning a new language now &ndash; Go &ndash; and it&rsquo;s time to learn how Go wants me to think about databases. Will it be sane or awkward? I don&rsquo;t know yet. The documentation doesn&rsquo;t take any time to introduce it, so I&rsquo;ll just work through it and see how it&rsquo;s done.</p>
