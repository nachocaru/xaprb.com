  <p>The servers I help manage have a lot of deadlocks, especially around a few central tables that are important to many business functions. The queries against them are complex, and they crunch a lot of data in some cases. As a result, we have long-running transactions that often deadlock against others, and there are even many short-running jobs that touch only a single row at a time that can&rsquo;t get their work done sometimes.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve often said that deadlocks are a fact of life in transactional systems. The application must be able to deal with the deadlocks. This is true, but it&rsquo;s not the whole story. The work needs to be done, unless it&rsquo;s user-triggered and the user gets frustrated and abandons what they&rsquo;re trying to do. That&rsquo;s not the case in the applications I use; if something fails, it will get retried until it succeeds, because work queues and doesn&rsquo;t go away until it&rsquo;s completed.</p>

<p>Depending on how long it takes for a process to deadlock, that can represent a huge amount of wasted work. A two-hour process that has to be restarted many times adds a lot of load to the system. This extra load in turn causes more deadlocks. It can become a vicious spiral, so it can be important to avoid deadlocks.</p>

<p>Avoiding deadlocks is a lot easier when you can observe them. This is difficult in MySQL, because you have to look at SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS for that information. I use pt-deadlock-logger to help with this. It still isn&rsquo;t perfect, in particular because SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS has a lot of problems. I hope that future versions of MySQL will provide this information through tables in some fashion. SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS is something I&rsquo;d love to never look at or parse again, but unfortunately some crucial information is still unavailable anywhere else.</p>

<p>A couple of the basic principles for avoiding deadlocks are to do the work in small units if possible, and to avoid processing the data in such a way that deadlocks occur. For example, the order of locking resources can matter a lot. Sometimes you don&rsquo;t have enough control over this to completely solve the problem, but sometimes it helps.</p>

<p>Here are a few other techniques I&rsquo;ve seen or used myself recently.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Creating work/scratch tables.</strong> Many long-running processes update particular tables and reference other tables in read-only mode, but deadlock because of write operations happening on the tables they&rsquo;re reading. Beginning the process by creating a scratch table with a copy of the rows needed from the read-only tables, then committing the transaction, can ease this problem by limiting the lock dependencies among processes.</li>
<li><strong>Moving work into the application.</strong> I&rsquo;ve recently replaced an INSERT..SELECT statement with a SELECT followed by an INSERT. As a bonus, this is more efficient for statement-based replication too.</li>
<li><strong>Retry, but not right away.</strong> Some processes were retrying deadlocked statements immediately. This is unlikely to succeed; waiting a while before retrying might give the conflicting process time to finish and release locks.</li>
</ol>

<p>In the longer term, I&rsquo;m looking forward to understanding the systems well enough to know whether a change to row-based replication and/or changing transaction isolation level will be possible. Those changes might help improve the systems in a variety of ways.</p>
