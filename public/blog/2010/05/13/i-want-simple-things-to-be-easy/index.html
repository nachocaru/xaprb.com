  <h1>I want simple things to be easy</h1>

      <p>I like to write tools that make hard things easy, when possible. By and large, MySQL is easy and simple. But some simple things are too hard with MySQL. I want to change that, at least for the things that matter the most to me, and which I think I know how to fix.</p>

<p>I will probably write a lot about this. I have already written a number of <del datetime="2010-05-13T13:10:55+00:00">rants</del> blog posts about the lack of instrumentation in MySQL, and that is where I&rsquo;ll probably continue to put most of my energy.</p>

<p>To begin with, imagine this simple scenario. You are a remote DBA. Your client says &ldquo;New Relic is showing periods of slow response time from the database.&rdquo; You connect to MySQL at the command line and try to troubleshoot. How do you catch the problem in action, from within the database itself? The following are no good:</p>

<ul>
<li>It doesn&rsquo;t count to see the problem two minutes later by observing the application tier, as New Relic does. That&rsquo;s too late, and it&rsquo;s not from within the database.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s also not good enough to catch just after the slow queries finish executing, which you can get from the slow query log if you have a realtime log analyzer running; that is a) also after the fact, and b) again not possible from within the database itself.</li>
<li>Watching TCP traffic or using a proxy is similarly off limits.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a database, a complex piece of software &ndash; comparable to an operating system in some respects. It should be possible to know that response time is spiking <em>while the slow queries are executing slowly, before they even finish and return their results to the application</em>. This is a simple question that should be easy to answer.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not currently possible inside MySQL, because MySQL doesn&rsquo;t tell you how much time queries spend executing. It&rsquo;s that simple. Fortunately the fix is equally simple: measure how long queries spend executing.</p>

<p>We can look at the lowly iostat (or /proc/diskstats in Linux) for an example of how this is possible to solve. We need a counter that shows the sum of execution time, including currently executing queries. I saw that the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=390420710932">Facebook patch</a> adds counters similar to this. Search for &ldquo;Query timing&rdquo; on that page. I want something slightly more complex, <a href="http://www.xaprb.com/blog/2010/01/09/how-linux-iostat-computes-its-results/">the way Linux&rsquo;s IO counters work, because they add memory</a>. Simple is really beautiful; a counter that has memory is an amazing thing, and you can apply Little&rsquo;s Law to derive a surprising amount of information from it.</p>

<p>I might change my opinion about some of the more complex things that are being added to MySQL; much smarter people have, and I&rsquo;m probably a hold-out because I&rsquo;m not that smart. But I still see the need for simple combinations of counters and timers for essential metrics, which do not need complex queries or tools to use. I have a few more things on my wishlist, which I&rsquo;ll write about later.</p>
