      <p>I perpetually see something like the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My server load is high and my queries are slow and my server crashes. Can you help me tune my server? Here is some information.</p>

<p>[random sample of SHOW GLOBAL STATUS, like the query cache counters]
my.cnf:</p>

<p><pre>[mysqld]
key_buffer_size=1500M
query_cache_size= 64M
max_connections = 256
key_buffer = 8M
sort_buffer_size = 100M
read_buffer_size = 8M
delay_key_write = ALL
</pre></blockquote>
There are many problems in this my.cnf file, but the sort_buffer_size is a glaring one that identifies the user as someone who should not be playing with live ammunition. Therefore, I have developed an advanced process for tuning sort_buffer_size, which you can follow to get <em>amazing</em> performance improvements. It&rsquo;s magical.</p>

<ol>
<li>How expert are you?

<ul>
<li>I know that there is a sort buffer, and that it is related to sort_merge_passes. When sort_merge_passes is high, I have been told to increase the sort_buffer_size. I also know that it is somehow related to the number of sorts the server does, so when there are a lot of sorts shown in variables like Sort_rows and Sort_scan, I think I should also increase it. <strong>You are a beginner</strong>.</li>
<li>I have been administering MySQL for many years. I know that there are two sort algorithms inside MySQL. I know exactly <a href="http://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/2010/02/28/why-you-should-ignore-mysqls-key-cache-hit-ratio/">how to optimize the key cache hit ratio</a>. <strong>You are a novice</strong>.</li>
<li>I have read every blog post Peter Zaitsev ever wrote, and I can improve on them all. <strong>You are an expert</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>Based on your score on the scale above, find your optimal sort_buffer_size tuning algorithm below:</p>

<ul>
<li>Beginners and novices should leave this setting at its default, and comment it out of the configuration file.</li>
<li>Experts don&rsquo;t need me to tell them what to do, but most of them will leave this setting at its default, and comment it out of the configuration file.</ol>
The most amazing thing about sort_buffer_size is how many people utterly ruin their server performance and stability with it, but <em>insist</em> that they know it&rsquo;s vital to change it instead of leaving at its default. I do not know why this is always the case. Why don&rsquo;t people choose random variables to destroy their performance? It&rsquo;s not as though there is a shortage to choose from. Why does everyone always pick sort_buffer_size instead of something else? It&rsquo;s like a flame drawing the moths in.</li>
</ul>

<p>Feel free to ask questions if anything is unclear, but be prepared for a direct answer if you ask for tuning advice.</p>

<p><small><em>PS: I considered a simpler tuning guide, such as <a href="http://mituzas.lt/2009/07/08/query-cache-tuning/">Domas&rsquo;s guide to tuning the query cache</a>, but I am convinced that people need more a complex guide for the sort_buffer_size, or they will not believe in the validity of the instructions. I base this on multiple experiences being paid a lot of money to suggest not setting sort_buffer_size to 256M, and being told that I must be an idiot.</em></small></p></li>
</ol>
