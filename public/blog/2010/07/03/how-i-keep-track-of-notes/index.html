      <p>This is the follow-up to my post on <a href="http://www.xaprb.com/blog/2010/06/30/how-i-keep-track-of-tasks/">how I keep track of tasks</a>. It&rsquo;s important for me to have a good system for keeping notes and other files organized. The problem usually turns out to be that I want them organized several different ways simultaneously: by date, by project, by person, by subject. Alas, if I keep them in files on a hard drive, I can only choose one such organizing strategy, because filesystems are a single hierarchy.</p>

<p>I choose to organize by date, simply because most of the time I need access to notes and files about things I&rsquo;m working on now or recently. If I need to find files by project or subject, there&rsquo;s a search feature in my file browser, and it works really well! So date-organization is good enough for me.</p>

<p>Inside my home directory, I have a directory per year, and inside that, a directory per month. If I write a note today, it goes into the $HOME/etc/<sup>2010</sup>&frasl;<sub>07</sub>/03/ directory. The filename starts with today&rsquo;s date. That&rsquo;s the simple organizing principle behind my note system. It also lets me eventually move things off my computer into permanent storage, so I don&rsquo;t have to keep backing things up forever and carrying around infinite amounts of data. I keep the last couple of years; if I need access to notes or projects from 2006, I can go pull a hard drive off the shelf and pop it into my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Vantec-NexStar-NST-D200SU-2-5-Inch-3-5-Inch/dp/B001QFNDXE/?tag=xaprb-20">hard drive dock</a> (buy one of those, and you&rsquo;ll never get ripped off again by external drives with their own enclosures and power supplies).</p>

<p>I still need a quick way to create files and place them there, or move them there after I create them. For creating files, I use Vim. There is nothing better than a plain-text editor for me. My Vim settings are such that if I begin a line with a hyphen, Vim keeps nice indentation for me, making it easy to take notes in bulleted lists with proper indentation. If you&rsquo;re on a call with me and you hear typing, I&rsquo;m probably taking notes into Vim.</p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s a pain to type out the full path to the file including the year, month, and date. So I created some helper scripts and put them into my $PATH. The most important are &rsquo;t&rsquo; and &lsquo;c&rsquo;. &rsquo;t&rsquo; simply uses Vim to edit a file. (It also creates any required directories, based on today&rsquo;s date.) So if I am on a call with Joe, I just type &rsquo;t joe&rsquo; into a terminal, and I&rsquo;m editing /home/baron/etc/<sup>2010</sup>&frasl;<sub>07</sub>/03-joe.txt.</p>

<p>The &lsquo;c&rsquo; tool cats the file&rsquo;s contents. If I type &lsquo;c joe&rsquo;, it executes &lsquo;cat /home/baron/etc/<sup>2010</sup>&frasl;<sub>07</sub>/03-joe.txt&rsquo;. This makes it easy to grep, copy and paste, and so on.</p>

<p>There are a few more tools: the &rsquo;m&rsquo; tool moves any file into the date-based hierarchy, so if I save a PDF of an order-confirmation page, for example, I can then &rsquo;m&rsquo; it and it goes into its proper place. And I have a few tools to list files I created today, yesterday, this week, and this month.</p>

<p>I have a very important convention: when I&rsquo;m taking notes and something becomes my responsibility to follow up on, I type TODO in the notes. After the call ends, I can grep for TODO in the file and quickly transfer the item into the task system I described in the post linked from above. This is how I can be confident that I&rsquo;m not forgetting anything I&rsquo;m supposed to do: I take notes and write it out as it happens, and then review the notes afterwards.</p>

<p>All told, this system kind of feels too simple to be a system. Everyone else seems to use complicated online gizmos named after groceries, or whizbang apps created by 37Signals, but I&rsquo;ve found none of them to meet my needs, and just went back to basics. Basic is good. Basic works. Basic lets me concentrate on what I&rsquo;m doing.</p>

<p>As I said in my previous post, part of this is based on the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0142000280?tag=xaprb-20">GTD</a> book, which I read through a couple of times (with a year in between) and picked the parts that made sense to me. I think it&rsquo;s a useful book to read, if you&rsquo;re having trouble organizing yourself. I would just caution against spending all your energy getting organized &ndash; leave a little energy for actually doing your work!</p>
