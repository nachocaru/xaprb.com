      <p>This weekend I backed up all my data, repartitioned my hard drive, and re-installed. I needed to do this because the only thing I had on the laptop was Ubuntu, and sadly, the reality is sometimes my clients use things that require me to use Windows (and sometimes a virtual machine won&rsquo;t solve that). So now I&rsquo;m dual-booting Windows. I think the last time I did that was sometime before 2001, so I&rsquo;ve regressed 9 years.</p>

<p>I took this opportunity to switch from Ubuntu to Fedora. Why? They both released new versions almost at the same time, and I grabbed the live CDs and noticed that Fedora just worked better &ndash; better support for dual monitors, for example. And some things about Ubuntu have always irked me, such as &ldquo;sorry, can&rsquo;t play WAV file, that&rsquo;s a proprietary codec, you must install some big package of proprietary codecs.&rdquo; WHAT? When did a codec become necessary to play a PCM file? Codec stands for &ldquo;code/decode&rdquo; and that doesn&rsquo;t make sense for PCM. Anyway, these are small things, but sometimes they add up. I did not do a default install of Fedora. I don&rsquo;t trust ext4, and ext3 works fine for me, so I stayed with that. I also disabled SELinux right away &ndash; no thanks, *shudder*.</p>

<p>The much bigger switch was ditching Thunderbird in favor of <a href="http://www.claws-mail.org/">Claws</a>. I last used Claws back in&hellip; 2003, maybe? It was called Sylpheed Claws then, and was GTK1 or so. Now it&rsquo;s much nicer looking. Anyway, Fedora installed Thunderbird 3, and after giving that a small test drive I decided that my long-standing love/hate relationship with Thunderbird was due for a change. I just need a mail client that can open a yes/no dialog in less than 1.5 seconds &ndash; is that too much to ask? I&rsquo;m much happier with Claws. I use email a lot, probably something like 350 emails per day, and I&rsquo;ve already found Claws more capable than Thunderbird in every way but one: I can&rsquo;t quite figure out how to get the functionality I got from Thunderbird&rsquo;s quicktext extension. Everything else is amazing &ndash; I don&rsquo;t need extensions, everything&rsquo;s built in by default. I use filters extensively, and the filtering and searching in Claws is much nicer than in Thunderbird. There are a handful of other things.</p>

<p>One notable thing is an archiving feature. I like to move emails to a folder after I&rsquo;m done with them. I had sort of a hack in Thunderbird. The key combination Ctrl+Shift+M moves the selected message(s) to the same folder used for the last move operation. This worked acceptably well, until I moved a message elsewhere and forgot that my &ldquo;archive&rdquo; key combo no longer sent my messages to the archive. In Claws, I set up a custom action and attached it to the Y key, and voila I have real archiving functionality (without pressing 3 keys, too). I also remapped keys so it&rsquo;s more vim-like. Gmail is the client I use for my personal accounts, so now I have consistent keystroke commands between both emails and my favorite text editor.</p>

<p>Another notable thing is that when I send an email, the sending process happens in the background. This is so much nicer. In Thunderbird, I&rsquo;d Ctrl-Enter and then have to alt-tab my way past the sending dialog and the compose window, back to the main window to keep working; in Claws, I press Ctrl+Enter to send, and I&rsquo;m immediately back at the main window. This might seem silly, but it&rsquo;s actually a big deal. It helps me process email quite a bit faster.</p>
