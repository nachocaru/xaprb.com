  <p>I&rsquo;ve written before about how to get accepted to the <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/mysql2011/">conference</a>. We want great technical submissions in a broad variety of topics, for databases well beyond MySQL. I wanted to post a quick list of things that come to my mind as good ways to get voted down or rejected out of hand. In general, I can put it this way: you are being peer-reviewed by presenters and industry experts. You need to write your proposal for the committee as well as for attendees. Lightly edited copy-and-paste from real examples:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In this tutorial, __ will teach a condensed version of his standard commercial training workshop, a $1,500 value.
THIS IS A MUST ATTEND FOR THOSE WHO WISH TO BECOME __ EXPERTS.
Sometimes being a committee member is fun. My all-time personal favorite, from the 2010 conference:
NETWORKING FOR TECHIES &ndash; BUILDING BUSINESS CONTACTS AT IT CONFERENCES&hellip; ___ ___ will guide you step-by-step through the networking process using demonstrations, exercises, role plays, and personal coaching that focus on networking between sessions, in workshops and at receptions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And then, in the additional notes area, which reviewers see but attendees don&rsquo;t, the submitter included this little gem: &ldquo;This fee-based session (TBA)&hellip;&rdquo; Oops! I almost didn&rsquo;t notice that you thought you could make the conference&rsquo;s business decisions for them!</p>

<p>In addition to these concrete examples, chest-thumping in general rarely goes over well. Keep in mind that some people on the review committee may have been called in to consult on the application you&rsquo;re boasting about, and found it less impressive than you may be conveying in your proposal. The reviewers will note that down, and we all see each others&rsquo; notes and votes, so a conversation about the background story is likely to develop during the voting process.</p>

<p>Sometimes I think that well-intentioned submitters don&rsquo;t realize that the submissions should be fully technical, and the products &#038; services track is available by <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/mysql2011/public/content/sponsors">contacting O&rsquo;Reilly directly about sponsorship</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>____ is trying to make it easy for start-ups&hellip; Initial pricing is $___ for a single server. <em>(This submission belongs in the expo hall, not the session rooms.)</em>
We will demonstrate why ___ appliances are optimal, showing examples of customer performance improvements.* (This looks like an infomercial.)*
If you have a product or service that you think will benefit from exposure at this conference, you should definitely talk to them about sponsorship. It is a win-win.</p>
