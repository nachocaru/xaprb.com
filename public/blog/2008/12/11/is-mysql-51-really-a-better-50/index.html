  <p>With all the furor over MySQL 5.1 GA, its release schedule, its quality, etc etc I think a fundamental claim is being left un-examined. Lots of people are saying that if you leave out the new features in 5.1 and look only at the features that existed in 5.0, it&rsquo;s better quality.</p>

<p>The implication is that the process of building 5.1 looked like this: rip out nasty code and fix it all up, so there&rsquo;s a brand new architecture free of code debt. Adjust existing features to use this new, high-quality, sensible server architecture. Add new features.</p>

<p>Is this accurate?</p>

<p>Time will tell, and I have not yet seen enough of 5.1 in real-world production environments. As Peter says, <a href="http://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/2008/12/10/mysql-51-went-to-ga-was-it-a-good-move/">it&rsquo;s not how many bugs there are &ndash; it&rsquo;s how many bugs affect you</a>. In my line of work, we see bugs that only show up if you&rsquo;re, for example, running a server with hundreds of thousands of tables. Or similar edge cases. I see a lot of routine things, too, but my point is that I am somewhat reserving my opinion about 5.1&#8242;s quality of existing features. As an example of what I mean, there were some bugs with 5.1 not using indexes correctly &ndash; a serious regression from 5.0. These have been fixed. Will there be others that haven&rsquo;t been found yet? Probably.</p>

<p>Here is my gut feeling about a few existing features: triggers were always a hack and remain a hack. The memory allocation algorithms of the query cache are suboptimal, and that hasn&rsquo;t changed fundamentally. Geospatial functions are largely unusable, and that hasn&rsquo;t improved. The <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=32665">silly behavior of correlated subqueries</a> has probably been MySQL&rsquo;s number one slap-me-in-the-forehead misfeature since it was introduced in 4.x, and that isn&rsquo;t fixed (it will be in 6.0, but that&rsquo;s a whole other topic). Failsafe replication is code rot that was partially implemented and then abandoned in 4.x, causes bugs, and they haven&rsquo;t even removed the code (<a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=11923">read the bug report!</a>). UNION still uses a temporary table, whether it&rsquo;s required or not. LOAD DATA FROM MASTER never worked to begin with, and it&rsquo;s still there &ndash; it causes problems and should be ripped out. The Federated engine is probably best left alone. <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=13669">Group commit is <em>still</em> broken for InnoDB</a> when binary logging and XA transactions are enabled. (This was broken during 5.0&#8242;s release, is a serious regression since 4.1, and is definitely a server architecture problem. So much for the beautiful new server architecture in 5.1?)</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong. I&rsquo;m not trying to bash 5.1&#8242;s quality. I&rsquo;m just taking issue with this unchallenged assertion that everything that wasn&rsquo;t introduced in 5.1 is rock solid, performs better, and works beautifully now. I don&rsquo;t know for sure; I suspect it is partially true and partially false, but time will tell.</p>

<p>I will say this: I&rsquo;m generally happier with the quality and stability of 5.0 in the last little while, say since 5.0.6x. If you don&rsquo;t need 5.1&#8242;s new features, why break something that works?</p>
