  <h1>Summary of beCamp 2008</h1>

<p>Yesterday I went to <a href="http://barcamp.org/beCamp2008">beCamp 2008</a> along with four roomfuls of other people interested in technology (perhaps close to 100 people total). The conference was a lot of fun. Not everything went as planned, but that was as planned. This was an <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/OpenSpace.html">Open Spaces conference</a> and I thought it worked very well. From an email <a href="http://www.opensourceconnections.com/">Eric Pugh</a> sent:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Basically it all boils down to:</p>

<p>Open Space is the Law of Two Feet: if anyone finds themselves in a place where they are neither learning nor contributing they should move to somewhere more productive. And from the law flow four principles:</p>

<ul>
<li>Whoever comes are the right people</li>
<li>Whatever happens is the only thing that could have</li>
<li>Whenever it starts is the right time</li>
<li>When it&rsquo;s over, it&rsquo;s over</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="toc_0">From Hadoop to Bang-Splat</h3>

<p>I used the law of two feet a time or two. In fact, the first session I wanted to go to, which was about <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/core/">Hadoop</a> and <a href="http://labs.google.com/papers/mapreduce.html">MapReduce</a>, had no knowledgeable attendees. Someone overslept. OK, that&rsquo;s the way it goes: move along.</p>

<p>From there I went to a session about Unix command-line productivity. Most of the sessions I saw were traditional in that they had one person standing up talking and many people sitting and listening, but not all. This one had several clever command-line gurus mentioning their favorite power tips.</p>

<p>I learned about bang-splat and bang-dollar. The bangs have always gotten me in Bash: I avoid them because I&rsquo;ve never felt like reading the Bash man page section on them. (Am I too lazy, or not lazy enough?) So it was great to hear some people say &ldquo;bang-splat and bang-dollar are great&rdquo; and then explain them. That was easy for me, and now I know how they can be useful to me.</p>

<p>This problem-first type of tip is great for me: tell me the problem, then how to solve it, rather than telling me what the solution is and leaving me guessing what kinds of problems I can solve with it. (The Bash man page is solution-first).</p>

<p>In case you&rsquo;re wondering, bang-splat substitutes the arguments to the last command, and bang-dollar substitutes the last argument of the last command. So, instead of this:</p>

<pre>$ touch file1 file2 file3
$ rm file1 file2 file3</pre>

<p>I can do this:</p>

<pre>$ touch file1 file2 file3
$ rm !*</pre>

<p>There were lots of other nice tips too.</p>

<h3 id="toc_1">MySQL Performance</h3>

<p>I ended up doing a talk on MySQL performance basics. I had no idea what the audience was looking for, so I winged it. I did make some slides, but most of the talk isn&rsquo;t on the slides. You can get the slides from <a href="http://www.percona.com/presentations.html">Percona&rsquo;s slide page</a>. It seemed to be useful to the folks attending, who had a wide variety of experience and knowledge about MySQL.</p>

<h3 id="toc_2">Cloud Computing</h3>

<p>This session began with a demo of how to create an entire application stack in a few minutes with <a href="http://www.cohesiveft.com/">Cohesive Flexible Technologies</a>. Someone else then demoed a similar thing using <a href="http://www.rightscale.com/">RightScale</a>. <a href="http://www.rpath.com/">rPath</a>&rsquo;s <a href="http:/http://www.xaprb.com/blogs.conary.com/index.php/juphoff">Jeff Uphoff</a> was also in the room, but we didn&rsquo;t get to see a demo of that. During this session the talk turned to various topics including a little bit of the topics I wanted to hear about in the Hadoop session.</p>

<h3 id="toc_3">Lunch</h3>

<p>Lunch was catered Indian food provided by the <a href="http://www.rimmkaufman.com/">Rimm-Kaufman Group</a>. Yum.</p>

<h3 id="toc_4">Large Scale Storage</h3>

<p>This session was sort of a round-table. The two people who talked the most were <a href="http://www.cv.nrao.edu/~jmalone/">Josh Malone</a> from the <a href="http://www.nrao.edu/">National Radio Astronomy Observatory</a> and the <a href="http://www.loc.gov/">Library of Congress</a>, both of whom have a lot of storage needs they are unsure how to meet. Some people from UVA&rsquo;s library were there as well, but I didn&rsquo;t ask what they were working on.</p>

<p>This reminded me a lot of a <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/mysql2008/public/schedule/detail/1865">recent keynote Jacek Becla gave at another conference</a>. He&rsquo;s with the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, who are going to be generating a lotta data pretty soon.</p>

<h3 id="toc_5">High Availability Linux</h3>

<p>This one started off with more from Josh Malone, who demoed <a href="http://www.nagios.org/">Nagios</a> briefly and then talked about his storage and backup systems. He uses <a href="http://backuppc.sourceforge.net/">BackupPC</a>, which sounds pretty neat and very smart. We then talked about some of the things he&rsquo;s looking into doing, with audience suggestions to look into shared storage or <a href="http://www.drbd.org/">DRBD</a>. We also looked at <a href="http://www.ultramonkey.org/">UltraMonkey</a> briefly &ndash; it looks like it&rsquo;s stagnating, though. And the <a href="http://linux-ha.org/">Linux HA</a> project.</p>

<h3 id="toc_6">Google App Engine</h3>

<p>Finally, someone showed us a <a href="http://gi89.appspot.com/">calculator application they&rsquo;d built on Google App Engine</a>, including the code and talking about the data model somewhat. It looks like a neat idea, but the lock-in worries me, a sentiment that was voiced by many others in the room.</p>
