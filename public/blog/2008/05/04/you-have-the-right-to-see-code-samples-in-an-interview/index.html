  <p>Joel Spolsky writes about <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html">12 steps to better code</a>, and elsewhere about how <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/GuerrillaInterviewing3.html">candidates should write code in interviews</a>.</p>

<p>The reverse conditions are true, too. If you&rsquo;re a candidate, you should evaluate the employer against the 12 steps, <strong>and you should also see code samples</strong>. How else will you know what you&rsquo;re getting into? You really have the right to do this, and you should exercise the right. If you don&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;ll get stuck in a crap job maintaining crap code. [dramatic voice] It happened to me.</p>

<p>In many companies, you can see code they&rsquo;ve released as open-source. (The fact that they&rsquo;ve done this says a lot about them.) But in others, you&rsquo;re going to need to surprise someone and say &ldquo;pick some code that&rsquo;s not sensitive and show it to me.&rdquo; Something simple, like the HTML for the search form on their website, or a utility to do some systems administration task. Any company is going to have a lot of code like this that they can show you.</p>

<p>The other approaches I see are to ask about it, assume, or ask the interviewer to write some code for you.</p>

<ol>
<li>Asking is a valid approach. If you see hesitation, or if someone says &ldquo;well, it&rsquo;s not as nice as we&rsquo;d like, and we&rsquo;re hoping you will offset that&rdquo; run don&rsquo;t walk, is my advice. If you&rsquo;re reading this as you consider your first job out of college or something, I strongly suggest not getting a job with a company that wants you to improve the way they do things. You should be learning from them, not vice versa.</li>
<li>You can also assume. &ldquo;Oh, they use Perl? Nevermind.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s a stupid approach. Really. Is it acceptable to judge people&rsquo;s character by the color of their skin? Then why would you judge their code by the language? In all seriousness, I have actually written very elegant, clean VBScript. And I mean, good-quality code by anyone&rsquo;s standards. It&rsquo;s hard in VBScript. It&rsquo;s easy in Perl if you <a href="http://www.xaprb.com/blog/2008/04/01/review-of-perl-best-practices/">follow the Dog</a>, which is a sign of great intelligence. Think about it this way: people who write beautiful Perl are people you should be eager to work with; they are rocket scientists. You will be the dumbest person in the room, and that should make you happy.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve never asked an interviewer to write code for me. Let me know how it works out for you.</li>
</ol>
