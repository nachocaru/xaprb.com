  <h1 class="post-title">How pre-fetching relay logs speeds up MySQL replication slaves</h1>

  <p>I dashed off a hasty post about <a href="http://www.xaprb.com/blog/2008/01/13/speed-up-your-mysql-replication-slaves/">speeding up replication slaves</a>, and gave no references or explanation. That&rsquo;s what happens when I write quickly! This post explains what the heck I was talking about.</p>

<p>I first heard Paul Tuckfield talk at the first MySQL Camp, in November 2006. He mentioned that he speeds up MySQL replication by &ldquo;pre-fetching relay logs&rdquo; on the slave. Actually, I think he used the term &ldquo;pipelining&rdquo; at that point. Next Spring, he mentioned the same thing in his <a href="http://technocation.org/content/2007-mysql-user-conference-and-expo-presentations-and-videos">keynote address at the 2007 MySQL Conference &#038; Expo</a>. You can download audio and video of his talk from that link. He mentions this approach pretty late in the talk, almost at the end. I&rsquo;ve been meaning to try duplicating his idea since the first time I heard him talk.</p>

<p>The basic idea is to help overcome replication&rsquo;s single-threadedness. Under the right conditions, the slave&rsquo;s SQL thread can become I/O-bound, even though the slave server has lots of unused I/O capacity. As a result, it spends a lot of time just waiting for the disk to return some data, and becomes much slower than it has to be.</p>

<p>Paul&rsquo;s solution to this problem is to read the statements from the relay log, just a little bit ahead of the SQL thread&rsquo;s position, convert them into SELECT queries, and execute them on the slave. This causes MySQL to request some of the data from the disk in advance. Then when the slave&rsquo;s SQL thread wants to update that data, it&rsquo;s already in memory, and things can potentially go much faster.</p>

<p>How much faster is open to debate. I think Paul sees about 3-4 times faster, but please don&rsquo;t quote me on that. <a href="http://mysqldatabaseadministration.blogspot.com/2007/05/pre-fetch-binlogs-to-speed-up-mysql.html">Farhan Mashraqui also uses this hack and gets some speedup as well</a>.</p>

<p>The problem is, it won&rsquo;t automatically work for everyone. In theory, it can potentially help if the following are true:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your data is much bigger than memory.</li>
<li>You use a storage engine with row-level locking, like InnoDB.</li>
<li>Your workload is mostly small (single-row is good), widely scattered, random UPDATE and DELETE statements. (INSERT is less likely to benefit, because the relevant indexes are likely to be &ldquo;hot&rdquo; already).</li>
<li>The slave&rsquo;s SQL thread is I/O-bound, but the slave has lots of spare I/O capacity. In other words, lots of disk spindles.</li>
</ul>

<p>My slaves don&rsquo;t do this kind of work. They do a lot of big multi-table updates and summary queries. There is very little to gain from pre-fetching the indexes and data for these statements, because whatever big query the SQL thread is running is likely to just flush the pre-fetched pages out of memory again before they&rsquo;re needed. I tried anyway, and sure enough, it didn&rsquo;t work.</p>

<p>The other problem is, it&rsquo;s hard to write a generically useful program to do this kind of pre-fetching. It&rsquo;s not too hard to write something specific to your workload, as Farhan did. But getting it to work right in general requires a lot of smarts, such as figuring out how far ahead of the slave SQL thread to stay, which queries not to try to pre-execute, and so on. I wrote an implementation of it that&rsquo;s generic and has some intelligence built in. If you&rsquo;re interested in it, see my previous post (linked at the top of this post).</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re thinking about writing something like this yourself, be prepared: it could be a lot of work. I can see how it would be simpler on some workloads, but on mine it was far from simple. I did some silly things, like running out of disk space because of temp files for LOAD DATA INFILE statements. Fortunately, that was just one of my benchmark machines.</p>

<p>If conditions aren&rsquo;t right, it could really screw you. For example, if your slave has only a single disk, or if you use MyISAM on the slave, you&rsquo;ll probably just cause problems for yourself. You need to know your hardware and your workload really well. That&rsquo;s why Paul didn&rsquo;t release his code, and I&rsquo;ve hesitated for the same reason.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s more information about this in the upcoming High Performance MySQL, 2nd Edition, which I&rsquo;m helping to write. We also have a lot more information about how to understand your hardware and workload. There&rsquo;s no way I can fit it all into this post, and I don&rsquo;t want to try. Even if I weren&rsquo;t working like a mad dog on the book and had time to put it here, I can&rsquo;t give away all the book&rsquo;s goodies, can I? :-)</p>
