      <p>Just thought I&rsquo;d update you. We got quite a few good errata from readers, and I took a couple weekends and went through the book with a fine-toothed comb, catching typos and subtle errors that crept in at some point (TPC benchmarks were labeled as TCP benchmarks &ndash; did you catch that one?). I marked up my book and mailed it to O&rsquo;Reilly, who went well above and beyond what they normally do for errata. Normally, once a book is in print they will fix only serious technical errors. They fixed everything, even going as far as rearranging page breaks and moving figures to improve readability.</p>

<p>The second printing is on Monday August 4th. Already! I think the book has been selling a lot better than anticipated. I know I am psyched to see it remain in the top couple thousand on Amazon. And they thought it was a big deal when it broke five thousand!</p>

<p>In other news, it&rsquo;s going to be translated into Spanish, Polish, and Portuguese. So now all my friends in Brazil will be able to read it in their native language.</p>

<p>And Percona&rsquo;s two expert consultants in Poland, too. No undue influence was exerted. I didn&rsquo;t even know it would be translated. Really! We do have a Spanish-speaking consultant who lives in Spain, but he is a native English speaker. Now, all we need are Russian, German, Lithuanian, and Ukrainian translations and I think we&rsquo;ve pretty well got the company covered, at least until we hire again.</p>
