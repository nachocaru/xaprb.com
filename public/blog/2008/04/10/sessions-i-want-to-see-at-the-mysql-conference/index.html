  <h1>Sessions I want to see at the MySQL Conference</h1>

      <p>This year&rsquo;s conference has a great lineup. As usual, with 8 sessions concurrently, it&rsquo;s impossible to pick which ones I want to see. However, I did learn a few things from last year&rsquo;s conference, which I think will help me get more out of it this time.</p>

<p>Number one rule: not all sessions are created equal. I can&rsquo;t say for sure, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure that when you see &ldquo;How Product X Will Scale Your Databases&rdquo; presented by a person from Company X, you can reasonably suspect that Company X is paying for this privilege, and it&rsquo;s not really a session as much as a product demo. These sessions were not reviewed and voted on by the community (I know, because I was one of the community members who were asked to review and vote on proposals. Maybe I&rsquo;m being a whistle-blower and won&rsquo;t get this honor next year as a result&hellip;)</p>

<p>Number two rule: if the description is vague, or if it sounds like regurgitation, I&rsquo;m skeptical. For example, if the summary starts off by saying &ldquo;Today&rsquo;s databases are dealing with more data than ever before. Data is mission-critical to today&rsquo;s business enterprises&rdquo; they lost me already. Writing that in a session description betrays thoughtlessness.</p>

<p>There actually are a couple of time slots that I am not really zinged about any of the sessions, and wish that I could see one of the sessions that&rsquo;s happening while I&rsquo;m presenting myself instead. But for the most part, there&rsquo;s more goodness than I can actually take in.</p>

<p>This year the conference website has become Web 2.0ish, in a good way. It lets you browse the schedule, and if you&rsquo;re logged in, you can &ldquo;star&rdquo; the ones you want to see. Then you get a personal calendar of all the ones you&rsquo;ve starred. Not only that, but when you look at a session, it shows you other sessions that other attendees have also starred. Pretty nice, if you&rsquo;re trying to figure out which sessions to see.</p>

<p>Here are the sessions I&rsquo;ve starred, in chronological order. It&rsquo;s a little too much work for me to link to them all.</p>

<ul>
<li>All Bases Covered: A Hands-on Introduction to High-availability MySQL and DRBD</li>
<li>Memcached and MySQL: Everything You Need To Know</li>
<li>New Subquery Optimizations in MySQL 6.0</li>
<li>The Lost Art of the Self Join</li>
<li>EXPLAIN Demystified</li>
<li>High Availability Landscape of MySQL</li>
<li>Disaster is Inevitable &ndash; Are You Prepared?</li>
<li>Services Oriented Architecture with PHP and MySQL</li>
<li>Database Integrity Protection with MySQL and DRBD</li>
<li>Falcon from the Beginning</li>
<li>Architecture of Maria: A New Storage Engine with a Transactional Design</li>
<li>The MySQL Query Cache</li>
<li>Grazr: Lessons Learned Building a Web 2.0 Application Using MySQL</li>
<li>Extending MySQL</li>
<li>Inside the PBXT Storage Engine</li>
<li>Helping InnoDB Scale on Servers with Many CPU Cores and Disks</li>
<li>Scaling Heavy Concurrent Writes In Real Time</li>
<li>High Availability MySQL with DRBD and Heartbeat: MTV Japan Mobile Services</li>
</ul>

<p>I might change my mind, but these look like a pretty good start.</p>

<p>Rule three: ask around. You can get the scoop, and it might make you change your mind. For example, would you go see the one about the &ldquo;Lost Art of the Self Join&rdquo; if I wasn&rsquo;t here telling you how much you don&rsquo;t want to miss that one?</p>

<p>Rule four: go to my sessions *wink*</p>
