  <h1>A different angle on the MySQL Conference</h1>

      <p>There are quite a few business angles you might see only if you&rsquo;re here at the conference, and you won&rsquo;t get from blogs. For example, let&rsquo;s take a look at the contents of the shoulder bags they hand out with your registration. (This is only a partial list.)</p>

<ul>
<li>SnapLogic&rsquo;s flyer gets it right: their system is compatible with &ldquo;GNU Linux.&rdquo; Hooray, a commercial company acknowledging the GNU operating system for what it is!</li>
<li>MySQL Enterprise&rsquo;s flyer has three big bullet points: MySQL Load Balancer, MySQL Connection Manager, and MySQL Enterprise Monitor Query Analyzer. The first two look like they&rsquo;re probably built on MySQL Proxy. The last has a visual explain plan feature, which according to an elevator conversation is not yet built. I&rsquo;ll stop by their booth and see. As you may know, <a href="http://www.maatkit.org/">Maatkit</a> has provided a tool (which is designed for integration into other tools) that shows a visual explain plan for a long time.</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s an issue of Linux Journal, which does <em>not</em> get the GNU part right. And it has no articles about MySQL. Off-topic! Discarded!</li>
<li>Infobright&rsquo;s flyer says they can load data nearly real-time. I don&rsquo;t know how you read it, but to me that says &ldquo;can&rsquo;t quite keep up with how fast you generate data.&rdquo; So&hellip; what good can it possibly be, right?</li>
<li>The conference bag itself has Zmanda&rsquo;s logo on the side.</li>
<li>Webyog&rsquo;s flyer has one side for SQLyog, and one for MONyog. Each side takes the sparse but visually appealing approach of shiny icons to present a feature list. My favorite is the &ldquo;Find slow SQL&rdquo; turtle.</li>
<li>JasperSoft&rsquo;s flyer has soothing, professional blues and rich reds. It makes them look very trustworthy. (I&rsquo;m not being snarky.) And they have lots of nice whitespace. It&rsquo;s a little bit of a different look.</li>
<li>Kickfire&rsquo;s marketing department is really on the ball. I&rsquo;ve seen a large number of flyers and other materials from them (online and offline) and they just changed their name and created a new logo and look-and-feel a short time ago. How do they do it so fast?</li>
<li>O&rsquo;Reilly has a bunch of half-sized flyers for their conferences. We should have asked them to throw in one about our upcoming book, the second edition of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596101716?ie=UTF8&amp;#038;tag=xaprb-20&amp;#038;link_code=as3&amp;#038;camp=211189&amp;#038;creative=373489&amp;#038;creativeASIN=0596101716">High Performance MySQL</a>. Alas, opportunity lost. By the way, stop by the bookstore and grab a copy of the sample chapter.</li>
<li>Zmanda, not content with stamping the outside of the bag, has a half-flyer inside it too, plus a chance to win a Digital Rebel to lure you to their booth. If you&rsquo;re doing backups the way a lot of people seem to, you might want to stop by their booth anyway&hellip;</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s a CD for a free trial of WinSQL. But the CD case doesn&rsquo;t say what the</li>
</ul>

<p>Sorry. I have a short attention span.</p>
