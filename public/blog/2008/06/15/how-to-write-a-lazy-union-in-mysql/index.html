  <h1>How to write a lazy UNION in MySQL</h1>

      <p>The other day I was explaining options to someone who wanted to know about <a href="http://www.xaprb.com/blog/2007/06/13/archive-strategies-for-oltp-servers-part-1/">archiving data in MySQL</a>. &ldquo;So,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I might have to code my app to look for the data in two places?&rdquo; The disadvantage of this is that his app might be more complex. Another disadvantage is that it might take two queries &ndash; if you look for a user in the usual location and it&rsquo;s not there, you have to look for it elsewhere.</p>

<p>One way to deal with this, as long as the archived data is on the same server, is a UNION.</p>

<pre>select user_id from user where user_id = 123
union all
select user_id from user_archive where user_id = 123;</pre>

<p>The benefit is that you don&rsquo;t have to issue two queries. That saves network round trips, and makes your code shorter. But it has a disadvantage, too: you&rsquo;re still querying the archive table when you don&rsquo;t need to. Does this matter? Yes, it does. Your archive table may be very large and slow &ndash; perhaps stored on a big slow hard drive, perhaps on a SAN &ndash; and just peeking at it is kind of expensive in some cases.</p>

<p>Something occurred to me a couple of weeks ago: why not write a UNION that stops executing as soon as one part of it finds a row? Then you can UNION to your heart&rsquo;s content and not incur the overhead of that second lookup unless you need it. For lack of a better term, I&rsquo;m calling this a lazy UNION.</p>

<p>My idea here is to use a user variable. If the first part of the UNION finds a row, it sets the variable. The second part has the variable in its WHERE clause, and won&rsquo;t execute if the variable has been set by the first part. To make the whole thing self-contained, I&rsquo;m adding a third part of the UNION, which will always execute but never return any rows; it will set the variable back to its initial state of NULL.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a complete example:</p>

<pre>drop table if exists user, user_archive;
create table user(user_id int not null primary key);
create table user_archive like user;
insert into user(user_id) values(1);
insert into user_archive(user_id) values(2);

select greatest(@found := -1, user_id) as user_id, 'user' as which_tbl
   from user where user_id = 1
union all
select user_id as user_id, 'user_archive' as which_tbl
   from user_archive where user_id = 1 and @found is null
union all
select 1, '' from dual where ( @found := null ) is not null;

select greatest(@found := -1, user_id) as user_id, 'user' as which_tbl
   from user where user_id = 2
union all
select user_id as user_id, 'user_archive' as which_tbl
   from user_archive where user_id = 2 and @found is null
union all
select 1, '' from dual where ( @found := null ) is not null;</pre>

<p>You can play around with it and verify that indeed, the second part of the UNION never executes if the first part finds a row. There are several ways to do this: with EXPLAIN, by adding some more variables to show which part of the query executes, etc. The results of the above query are as follows:</p>

<pre>+---------+-----------+
| user_id | which_tbl |
+---------+-----------+
|       1 | user      | 
+---------+-----------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

+---------+--------------+
| user_id | which_tbl    |
+---------+--------------+
|       2 | user_archive | 
+---------+--------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)</pre>

<p>I have not benchmarked this. My gut feeling is that whether it&rsquo;s beneficial is going to depend on your workload. But it&rsquo;s a fun little hack I thought I&rsquo;d share with you. By the way, there&rsquo;s no reason you have to stop at two; you could add any number of queries to the UNION.</p>
