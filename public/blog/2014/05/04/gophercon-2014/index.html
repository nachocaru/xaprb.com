  <p>I spoke at <a href="http://gophercon.com/">Gophercon</a> last week in Denver, and it was one of the best
conferences I&rsquo;ve attended. I can&rsquo;t remember learning so much and meeting so many
great people in years. I have page after page of notes in my notebook, many of
which I&rsquo;ve yet to follow up on. The conference prompted a burst of learning and
a flurry of creativity for me, as well as a huge list of things to study
further.</p>

<p><img src="/media/2014/05/gophercon.png" alt="Gophercon" />
</p>

<p>In no particular order, here are some of the many highlights for me:</p>

<ul>
<li>Meeting some of the Go team. Most of the people I&rsquo;ve been interacting with or
following online were there, although I didn&rsquo;t get to meet all of them in
person.</li>
<li>Meeting many of the super-smart people whose code, blogs, and emails have
taught me so much over the last couple of years.</li>
<li>Learning a lot about Go&rsquo;s internals and design. For example, although it seems
obvious in hindsight, I had never really thought about the <code>select</code> statement
as the heart of Go&rsquo;s concurrency model &ndash; but it is. Everything else in Go
seems to get the attention (channels, goroutines, etc), and is copied in
various languages, but <code>select</code> is really the crowning jewels and is unique as
far as I know.</li>
<li>The talks. I haven&rsquo;t listened to talks so intently for many years. I was able
to attend all but two. Fortunately those were recorded and will be online
soon. The speakers were so good that I truthfully started to get an insecurity
complex about my own presentation. I could just list all of the talks, and I
don&rsquo;t want to pick favorites, but if you must watch only a couple &ndash;
watch <a href="http://talks.golang.org/2014/hellogophers.slide">Rob Pike</a>, <a href="http://talks.golang.org/2014/go4gophers.slide">Andrew Gerrand</a>, John Graham, Kelsey Hightower, Ben
Johnson, Peter Bourgon, Alan Shreve, Richard Crowley, oh dear that&rsquo;s more than
a few. If you use or are curious about Go, you <em>must</em> watch the first two.
The slides are good to read, but you are missing 80% of the talk if that&rsquo;s all
you make time for.</li>
</ul>

<p>I was going to write a pretty long retrospective about Gophercon, but another
amazing Gopher <a href="http://influxdb.org/blog/2014/04/30/java-is-the-cobol-of-my-generation-and-go-is-its-successor.html">already did that</a> (update: <a href="http://blog.joshsoftware.com/2014/05/05/my-experience-at-the-awesome-first-ever-gophercon-2014/">another one</a>).  I encourage you to read it, as it will
give you a good sense of the conference and Go, and how they fit together.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll leave you with some pithy quotes that summarize the depth of the content
and quality of the hallway track at this conference:</p>

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;I will now boot this virtual machine from my slideshow.&rdquo; - Kelsey Hightower.  Note: this is not a joke; he PXE-booted the box using a server program that was running from his slideshow, which was written in Go and ran a Go PXE server. A few minutes later he booted another virtual machine from the first machine that booted from his slideshow.</li>
<li>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s turtles all the way down and Handler all the way up.&rdquo; - Richard Crowley, on building HTTP API services by composition using the <code>net/http</code> libraries.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Interfaces separate data from behavior. Classes conflate the two.&rdquo; - Andrew Gerrand, on the difference between programming with composition versus inheritance.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Go is profoundly different.&rdquo; - Rob Pike, addressing the common misconception that Go is little more than an elegant version of C</li>
<li>&ldquo;Go has generics. They are called interfaces.&rdquo; - Rob Pike, not speaking in jest</li>
<li>&ldquo;The only decison no one has second-guessed is writing this in Go.&rdquo; - Josh Bleecher Snyder</li>
</ul>
