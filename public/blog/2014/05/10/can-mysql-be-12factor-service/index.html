  <p>A while ago I <a href="http://www.xaprb.com/blog/2012/04/24/the-mysql-init-script-mess/">wrote</a> about some of the things that can make MySQL unreliable or hard to operate. Some time after that, in a completely unrelated topic, someone made me aware of a set of principles called <a href="http://12factor.net">12-factor</a> that I believe originated from experiences building Heroku.</p>

<p><img src="/media/2014/05/dodecahedron.jpg" alt="Dodecahedron" />
</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s been over a year, and I&rsquo;ve come to increasingly agree with the 12-factor principles. I guess I&rsquo;m extremely late to the party, but making applications behave in 12-factor-compliant ways has solved a lot of problems for me.</p>

<p>This experience has repeatedly reminded me of one of the applications that continues to cause a lot of the kinds of pain that the 12-factor principles have solved for me: MySQL.</p>

<p>Example: configuration files. I initially thought MySQL&rsquo;s technique of multiple configuration files that serve as defaults, overrides to the defaults, and eventually are overridden by the commandline options was a good thing. In fact, you can blame me for that pattern being imitated in Percona Toolkit, if you want to blame anyone for it.</p>

<p>But then I started to see the problems with it. Quick question: how easy is it to set up multiple MySQL instances on the same server, in your opinion? Had any problems with that? Any unexpected things ever happen to you?</p>

<p>12-factor solves many of the types of problems I&rsquo;ve had with that. For example, I once needed multiple instances of an API server on a single operating system host. This was very difficult because of conflicts with configuration files and init scripts, which I&rsquo;d created by copying the way MySQL does things. Moving the configuration into the environment variables solved most of those problems and helped solve others.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t necessarily expect anyone to understand this unless they&rsquo;ve had first-hand experience with it. After all, I didn&rsquo;t until I got that experience myself. I know a lot of people believe fully in the results of following 12-factor principles, so I won&rsquo;t spend time trying to explain it here.</p>

<p>Thought experiment: how hard would it be to make MySQL accept all of its configuration as environment variables? I think it would be feasible to make a wrapper that reads the environment variables and exec&rsquo;s <code>mysqld</code> with the resulting options. But if MySQL could be configured via environment variables directly, that&rsquo;d be even nicer. (I can&rsquo;t think of an environment variable it respects at the moment, other than <code>TZ</code>.)</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t propose blindly following 12-factor principles. They are most applicable to stateless or little-state applications, such as API servers or web applications. They are harder to use with attachable stateful resources, such as a database server. But even a system like MySQL could sometimes be improved, with regards to operational characteristics, by following 12-factor principles.</p>
