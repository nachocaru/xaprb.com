  <h1>Xaprb now uses Hugo</h1>

      <p>I&rsquo;ve switched this blog from Wordpress to <a href="http://hugo.spf13.com">Hugo</a>. If you see any broken links or
other problems, let me know. I&rsquo;ll re-enable comments and other features in the
coming days.</p>

<p><strong>Why not Wordpress?</strong> I&rsquo;ve used Wordpress since very early days, but I&rsquo;ve had my
fill of security problems, the need to worry about whether a database is up and
available, backups, plugin compatibility problems, upgrades, and performance
issues. In fact, while converting the content from Wordpress to Markdown, I
found a half-dozen pages that had been hacked by some link-farm since around
2007. This wasn&rsquo;t the first such problem I&rsquo;d had; it was merely the only one I
hadn&rsquo;t detected and fixed. And I&rsquo;ve been really diligent with Wordpress
security; I have done things like changing my admin username and customizing my
<code>.htaccess</code> file to block common attack vectors, in addition to the usual
&ldquo;lockdown&rdquo; measures that one takes with Wordpress.</p>

<p>In contrast to Wordpress or other CMSes that use a database, static content is
secure, fast, and worry-free. I&rsquo;m particularly happy that my content is all in
Markdown format now. Even if I make another change in the future, the content is
now mostly well-structured and easy to transform as desired. (There are some
pages and articles that didn&rsquo;t convert so well, but I will clean them up later.)</p>

<p>Why Hugo? There are <a href="http://staticsitegenerators.net">lots</a> of static site generators. Good ones include
Octopress and Jekyll, and I&rsquo;ve used those. However, they come with some of their
own annoyances: dependencies, the need to install Ruby and so on, and
particularly bothersome for this blog, performance issues. Octopress ran my CPU
fan at top speed for about 8 minutes to render this blog.</p>

<p>Hugo is written in Go, so it has zero dependencies (a single binary) and is
fast. It renders this blog in a couple of seconds. That&rsquo;s fast enough to run it
in server mode, <code>hugo server -w</code>, and I can just alt-tab back and forth between
my writing and my browser to preview my changes. By the time I&rsquo;ve tabbed over,
the changes are ready to view.</p>

<p>Hugo isn&rsquo;t perfect. For example, it lacks a couple of features that are present
in Octopress or Jekyll. But it&rsquo;s more than good enough for my needs, and I
intend to contribute some improvements to it if I get time. I believe it has the
potential to be a leading static site/blog generator going forward. It&rsquo;s already
close to a complete replacement for something like Jekyll.</p>
