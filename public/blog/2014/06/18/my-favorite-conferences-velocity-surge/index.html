<p>Two of my favorite conferences are coming up. One&rsquo;s just next week, and
another&rsquo;s in the fall.</p>

<h3 id="toc_0">Velocity</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-7094008-11742203">Velocity</a> is such a great event.
I wanted to go for years, and when I finally did it was honestly one of the
highlights of my professional career. I still don&rsquo;t know what I did get get
invited to speak that first year. It was a golden horseshoe falling out of the
sky and landing right in front of me.</p>

<p><img src="/media/2014/06/velocity.png" alt="Velocity" />
</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not the talks (though those are great). It&rsquo;s the people. The people
at Velocity are the people I want to spend my career with, the people thinking
about the same types of problems I am, the people trying to work on similar
solutions. They&rsquo;re building companies, they&rsquo;re making open source, they&rsquo;re
customers, they&rsquo;re consultants, they&rsquo;re just passionate practitioners. It&rsquo;s just
amazing what happens when this kind of group gets together.</p>

<p>And yeah, it&rsquo;s partially because I&rsquo;m a loyal O&rsquo;Reilly fan. I admit it: I love
O&rsquo;Reilly, I truly do. It&rsquo;s a remarkable group of people that has inspired me for
more than a decade, and I owe a lot of who I am to O&rsquo;Reilly.</p>

<p>Velocity starts next Tuesday in Santa Clara. If you don&rsquo;t go to that one,
there&rsquo;s several other incarnations in New York, Barcelona, and Beijing at
different times of the year. I&rsquo;ll be in Santa Clara next week, in the
<a href="https://vividcortex.com/">VividCortex</a> booth. Come say hi if you&rsquo;re there.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an affiliate link that has a 20% discount code embedded in it:

<h3 id="toc_1">Surge</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve often said that <a href="http://surge.omniti.com/">Surge</a> is Velocity without the grandiosity and with more
emphasis on hardcore software and systems engineering &mdash; and a much smaller
price tag.</p>

<p><img src="/media/2014/06/surge.png" alt="Surge" />
</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been at every Surge event since the beginning, and I would not miss it.
It&rsquo;s that good. I can say all the same things about Surge as I can about
Velocity, except it&rsquo;s a lot easier and less expensive to get to, and it&rsquo;s a lot
easier to decide to attend the talks there. At Velocity sometimes I feel lost
because the event is so big, and I end up not really attending many
presentations, and just hanging out in the hallway track. Not so at Surge.
Bonus: talks are always recorded and online, so you can go find out for yourself
how good they are.</p>

<p>The climate at Surge is also quite different in terms of the topics. Velocity is
ostensibly about the Web: backend, frontend, browser, and mobile are front and
center. As a result, you can certainly find yourself in an unfamiliar clique, if
you&rsquo;re, say, a database administrator at a lunch table full of people who want to
argue about how much hardware acceleration will save battery life in a mobile
browser. Whether that bothers you or not is up to you, but I&rsquo;ve found that Surge
is birds of my feather for sure. It&rsquo;s all about people who build what runs the
Internet (not necessarily what you use to engage with the Internet).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pretty loyal to the folks behind Surge, too. For one thing, a lot of them
are the same people who make Velocity awesome. For another, many of them have
helped me tremendously in my career and in founding VividCortex.</p>

<p>Surge is in early-bird pricing right now. Having run conferences before, I know
why early-bird pricing exists. If you think you&rsquo;ll attend, do yourself and them
a favor and sign up at a discount now. Here, click <a href="http://surge.omniti.com/2014">this</a>.</p>

<h3 id="toc_2">Conclusions</h3>

<p>There are no conclusions. Conferences are good. I love Velocity. I love Surge.
Go. Learn a lot. Share a lot. Make the world a better place.</p>
