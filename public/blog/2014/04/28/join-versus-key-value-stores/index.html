  </span>
  <p>I was listening to a conversation recently and heard an experienced engineer express an interesting point of view on joins and key-value databases. I don&rsquo;t entirely agree with it. Here&rsquo;s why.</p>

<p><img src="/media/2014/04/loc.jpg" alt="Library Of Congress" />
</p>

<p>First, the opinion. If I may paraphrase, the discussion was something like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>With experience in building distributed systems, one learns to avoid JOIN.</li>
<li>Therefore, much of the work of JOIN is done in the application instead of the database.</li>
<li>Access to the database is usually reduced to simple primary-key lookups.</li>
<li>Therefore, a key-value store is as good a choice as a relational database.</li>
</ul>

<p>I&rsquo;m simplifying, because the speaker actually suggested that MySQL makes a really good database for primary-key lookups as well.</p>

<p>The place I would differ slightly is on the last bullet point.  It really depends on which key-value store you choose. The subtlety I&rsquo;d suggest to consider is whether you&rsquo;d like a simple key-value store that can do only simple key-value set/get operations, or whether you want something that also provides more functionality if needed. I would argue that for most use cases, there is at least occasional need for something more sophisticated, and often there&rsquo;s a frequent need.</p>

<p>The more &ldquo;sophisticated&rdquo; uses I&rsquo;m talking about would include things such as evaluating expressions against the data, or performing operations such as <code>GROUP BY</code>. Both of these are orthogonal to use of <code>JOIN</code>. Consider how many times you&rsquo;ve done something like the following:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT DISTINCT status FROM posts;

SELECT author, COUNT(*), SUM(IF(status='draft'), 1, 0) FROM posts
GROUP BY author
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT 50;
</code></pre>

<p>Answering such ad-hoc (or routine) questions about your data can be a lot of work if you don&rsquo;t have an expressive query language. It can also be very performance-intensive, requiring you to fetch potentially enormous amounts of data out of the database to be processed in-app.</p>

<p>This doesn&rsquo;t have to imply that you need a relational database. Most key-value stores provide some useful functionality. Many provide at least map-reduce to operate on sets of keys. Many treat the value as a non-opaque data structure and allow you to write arbitrary functions to operate on it in some fashion, even if it&rsquo;s not as terse as SQL.</p>

<p>Some key-value databases seem to provide a little more functionality than they really do. For example, Cassandra&rsquo;s CQL can lead developers to think the power of a limited form of SQL is available to them. Although they may know perfectly well that CQL is essentially a human-friendly way of specifying a set of keys, the syntactical similarity to SQL can lull smart people into acting as if they are working with a more expressive language. This could cause you to write an application as though it&rsquo;ll be easy to do things that, when you later need to do them and can&rsquo;t with CQL alone, make you kick yourself a little bit.</p>

<p>Of course, the way you&rsquo;d want to support such a use case in a database like Cassandra is ideally to anticipate it and to store denormalized data that can answer the question quickly. Although this may seem limiting to a relational database user, it is really equivalent to creating an index, in terms of the need for foresight. Clearly, one can think of lots of ad-hoc queries against large relational tables that will not be feasible without indexes to support them. You need to do some planning either way.</p>

<p>To sum up: A big advantage (or foot-gun) of a relational database is that ad-hoc queries with complex expressions can be evaluated directly against the data, without moving it across the network. This is possible in some key-value stores, naturally, but not all. So I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s as simple as &ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t need joins, you aren&rsquo;t doing anything a key-value database can&rsquo;t do too.&rdquo; (That is, again, a paraphrase.)</p>
