      <p>I had a great time at Percona Live. I think this was the best MySQL
conference I&rsquo;ve ever been to.  (The food was excellent too. The fastest way to a
man&rsquo;s heart is through his stomach.)</p>

<p>The talks I attended were very good. Jay Janssen&rsquo;s tutorial on Percona XtraDB
Cluster was impressive. I can&rsquo;t imagine how much time he must have spent
preparing for that.</p>

<p>I was very happy that Oracle, MariaDB, and WebScaleSQL had a strong presence,
too. There were also a lot of one-degree-of-separation talks on topics like
Hadoop and so forth. I attended a talk by Google on how their F1 database works.
The biggest surprise in that talk? F1 is more expensive for them to operate than
MySQL. I expected that anything they built in-house would surely be more cost
effective, but I was wrong.</p>

<p>The community awards and lightning talks were fun as always. My co-founder Kyle
Redinger was scheduled to do a non-technical lightning talk about how to squat
properly. (He&rsquo;s a hardcore CrossFitter, gym owner, and coach.) He ended up
having a conflict, so Tim Chadwick from Dyn took over, and I played Vanna White.
And I mean <em>white</em>, as in White Gym Socks Clearly Visible On Skinny Legs. What
good is a lightning talk if you don&rsquo;t look goofy?</p>

<p>The expo hall was great for us (VividCortex). I was so busy at the booth
that I didn&rsquo;t spend a lot of time visiting other booths. We certainly got
our money&rsquo;s worth from having this booth, and have already decided to commit
early for next year&rsquo;s event.</p>

<p>Speaking of VividCortex, you may know that we launched our product during the
conference. The actual launch was at DEMO Enterprise, a launch event, but the
two events overlapped somewhat. Now that we&rsquo;ve launched, our closed beta is
ended, and you can sign up for a free trial at <a href="https://vividcortex.com">https://vividcortex.com</a>.</p>

<p>It was great to see so many old friends at the conference. I wish I&rsquo;d been able
to spend more time with more people, as I always wish every single year.
Many of the old traditions carry on; and we create new ones. Next year, join me
and Kyle for a Tech WOD (workout of the day) at a local Crossfit. It&rsquo;s a great
way to start the day off right at 6:30am after a late night of drinking!</p>
