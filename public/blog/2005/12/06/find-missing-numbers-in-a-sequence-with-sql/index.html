<p>Sometimes it is important to know which values in a sequence are missing, either to find unused values so they can be used, or to find &ldquo;holes&rdquo; in the data. In this article I&rsquo;ll show you how to find missing values, how to find the start and end of ranges of missing values, and how to optimize the queries for best performance.</p>

<h3 id="toc_0">Exclusion joins</h3>

<p>Possibly the most efficient technique, depending upon the application, is to use an <a href="http://www.xaprb.com/blog/2005/09/23/how-to-write-a-sql-exclusion-join/">exclusion join</a> against a list of all legal values (for example, an <a href="http://www.xaprb.com/blog/2005/12/07/the-integers-table/">integers table</a>). For instance, at my current employer we assign a unique tracking ID to certain bits of data. For reasons lost in the mist of time, we use three-character combinations of letters and numbers. It&rsquo;s effectively a base-36 number system. It is not the most efficient thing to work with in SQL! Since there is no magical built-in way to get the database to assign the next unused value in the sequence, we keep a table with all 36<sup>3</sup> legal values, and do an exclusion join against the list of legal values. This is an acceptable way to find the next values, but of course it&rsquo;s nowhere near optimal; when transactional consistency is needed, we have to lock tables up and do an expensive query. An identity (auto_increment) column would be preferable.</p>

<p>Putting three-character codes behind and assuming you want to analyze some existing data for holes without creating lists of legal values, it is possible to find missing values in a sequence by matching it against itself. For example, I am helping someone design a database to store information about gravestones. The original data was hand-entered into a spreadsheet, with a single column to keep track of gravestone numbers. There are duplicate and missing values in the sequence, both of which can indicate data problems, so it&rsquo;s highly desirable to find and fix them. After importing the spreadsheets verbatim into a staging table, I ran a number of analyses to find data problems before transforming the data into the final tables.</p>

<h3 id="toc_1">The setup</h3>

<p>If you want to follow along with the examples, you can run the following queries to create some sample data in MySQL:</p>

<pre>create table sequence (
    id int not null primary key
);

insert into sequence(id) values
    (1), (2), (3), (4), (6), (7), (8), (9),
    (10), (15), (16), (17), (18), (19), (20);</pre>

<p>Notice the values 5, 11, 12, 13, and 14 are missing from the sequence. If you are using Microsoft SQL Server, change <code>sequence</code> to <code>#sequence</code> from here on:</p>

<pre>create table #sequence (id int not null primary key)

insert into #sequence(id)
    select 1
    union all select 2
    union all select 3
    union all select 4
    union all select 6
    union all select 7
    union all select 8
    union all select 9
    union all select 10
    union all select 15
    union all select 16
    union all select 17
    union all select 18
    union all select 19
    union all select 20</pre>

<h3 id="toc_2">Finding duplicate and missing numbers</h3>

<p>Finding duplicate numbers is easy:</p>

<pre>select id, count(*) from sequence
group by id
having count(*) > 1;</pre>

<p>In this case there are no duplicates, since I&rsquo;m not concentrating on that in this post (finding duplicates is straightforward enough that I hope you can see how it&rsquo;s done). I had to scratch my head for a second to find missing numbers in the sequence, though. Here is my first shot at it:</p>

<pre>select l.id + 1 as start
from sequence as l
  left outer join sequence as r on l.id + 1 = r.id
where r.id is null;</pre>

<p>The idea is to exclusion join against the same sequence, but shifted by one position. Any number with an adjacent number will join successfully, and the <code>WHERE</code> clause will eliminate successful matches, leaving the missing numbers. Here is the result:</p>

<table class="borders collapsed">
  <tr>
    <th>
      start
    </th>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      5
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      11
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      21
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h3 id="toc_3">Find ranges of missing values with subqueries</h3>

<p>The above query identifies the start of ranges of missing numbers, but not the end. It also gives a false positive for 21, which is a missing number because it&rsquo;s off the end of the whole sequence. I wanted to solve both problems. After squinting at it a while, I realized I could solve this problem with a correlated subquery, as follows:</p>

<pre>select start, stop from (
  select m.id + 1 as start,
    (select min(id) - 1 from sequence as x where x.id &gt; m.id) as stop
  from sequence as m
    left outer join sequence as r on m.id = r.id - 1
  where r.id is null
) as x
where stop is not null;</pre>

<p>The final <code>WHERE</code> clause makes sure the upper end of the sequence isn&rsquo;t counted as a hole. This can be written several ways, some of them without wrapping the whole thing in a subquery (for example, <code>where r.id is null and r &lt; (select max(id) from sequence)</code>), but it suits me fine as it is. Here is the result:</p>

<table class="borders collapsed">
  <tr>
    <th>
      start
    </th>
    
    <th>
      stop
    </th>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      5
    </td>
    
    <td>
      5
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      11
    </td>
    
    <td>
      14
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>If the sequence is a another data type, such as dates or letters of the alphabet, it is often possible to use some other functions to get the &ldquo;next&rdquo; value in the sequence in the join condition. For example, if the <code>id</code> column is <code>CHAR(1)</code>, here is a query for MySQL:</p>

<pre>insert into sequence(id) values
    ('a'), ('b'), ('c'), ('e'),
    ('f'), ('g'), ('l'), ('m'), ('n');

select start, stop from (
    select char(ascii(m.id) + 1) as start,
        (select char(min(ascii(id)) - 1) from sequence as x where x.id &gt; m.id) as stop
    from sequence as m
        left outer join sequence as r on ascii(m.id) = ascii(r.id) - 1
    where r.id is null
) as x
where stop &lt;&gt; '';</pre>

<p>It&rsquo;s necessary to change the final <code>WHERE</code> clause to <code>stop &lt;&gt; ''</code> because <code>CHAR()</code> skips <code>NULL</code>s, converting <code>CHAR(NULL)</code> to the empty string. Here is the result:</p>

<table class="borders collapsed">
  <tr>
    <th>
      start
    </th>
    
    <th>
      stop
    </th>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      d
    </td>
    
    <td>
      d
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      h
    </td>
    
    <td>
      k
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h3 id="toc_4">Performance analysis: rewriting without subqueries</h3>

<p>I don&rsquo;t like correlated subqueries. In fact, I avoid subqueries if at all possible. Correlated subqueries are especially bad because, depending on the query optimizer, they may force the RDBMS to build a temporary table and probe into it for <em>each value</em> in the left-most table, which is O(n<sup>2</sup>). It dawned on me that the query could be written as <a href="http://www.xaprb.com/blog/2005/09/23/how-to-write-a-sql-exclusion-join/">left joins</a>:</p>

<pre>select l.id + 1 as start, min(fr.id) - 1 as stop
from sequence as l
    left outer join sequence as r on l.id = r.id - 1
    left outer join sequence as fr on l.id &lt; fr.id
where r.id is null and fr.id is not null
group by l.id, r.id;</pre>

<p>Of course, this is hardly, if at all, better. The <code>&lt;</code> in the join condition makes the join essentially a <code>CROSS JOIN</code>, which is still an O(n<sup>2</sup>) join. Just to see how the query optimizer handles this, I ran it through both MySQL and Microsoft SQL server, and looked at the query plans. I filled the table with values up to 5000 (large enough that the DBMSs would create statistics on the index) and then made holes in the sequence as follows:</p>

<table class="borders collapsed">
  <tr>
    <th>
      start
    </th>
    
    <th>
      stop
    </th>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      5
    </td>
    
    <td>
      5
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      11
    </td>
    
    <td>
      14
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      100
    </td>
    
    <td>
      100
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      855
    </td>
    
    <td>
      855
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      1230
    </td>
    
    <td>
      1230
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      2400
    </td>
    
    <td>
      2500
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>SQL Server actually optimized the first query significantly better, which highlights one of my favorite principles: <strong>always measure performance</strong>, and never try to &ldquo;optimize by eye!&rdquo; Here are the numbers (see my article about <a href="http://www.xaprb.com/blog/2005/11/30/quickly-compile-query-statistics-from-sql-query-analyzer/">using awk to sum up query statistics</a>):</p>

<pre>-- query one --
Scans:                  9
Logical reads:         35
Physical reads:         0
Read-ahead reads:       0
CPU time:              10 ms
Elapsed time:          49 ms

 -- query two --
Scans:                  9
Logical reads:         77
Physical reads:         0
Read-ahead reads:       0
CPU time:              60 ms
Elapsed time:         148 ms</pre>

<p>MySQL&rsquo;s results did not vary as much; the execution time was .8% faster on the first query, and the <code>EXPLAIN</code> result showed that the second query caused &lsquo;Range checked for each record&rsquo;. The two query plans were actually very different, according to <code>EXPLAIN</code>.</p>
