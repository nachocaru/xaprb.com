  <h1 class="post-title">A comment on comments</h1>

  <p>Comments are one of the most abused programming techniques. I know I&rsquo;m not the first to say this, but it bears repeating. There are hundreds of ways to misuse comments, and very few ways to use them correctly. In this article I&rsquo;ll pick on just one way to misuse them: fustian pontificating.</p>

<p>Albert Einstein said something like &ldquo;things should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler&rdquo; (it&rsquo;s unclear what he actually said, so I&rsquo;m paraphrasing). Einstein&rsquo;s greatest genius, in fact, was his ability to help ordinary people understand the esoterica of relativity &ndash; a subject most physicists would have had trouble explaining to other physicists. Yet he wrote with such simplicity and clarity that I know people who were able to read his work at age ten and grok the essential ideas. This is the mark of true genius: making specialized things accessible to non-specialists.</p>

<p>In &ldquo;Walden,&rdquo; Thoreau advised: <em>simplify, simplify, simplify.</em> Emerson is supposed to have responded, &ldquo;I think one &lsquo;simplify&rsquo; would have sufficed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In that light, let us examine one of the worst comments I have ever seen in code:</p>

<pre>/*
 * Delayhover effectively creates a phase-shifted version of sfhover
 * that runs parallel with it.  The CSS listens for any of the hover
 * options: :hover, .sfhover, and .delayhover.  There are multiple
 * checkpoints in the code to prevent asynchronous modification of the
 * same objects, or at least provide recovery (If a menu gets left open
 * somehow, a mouseover-mouseout will probably fix it - I've never
 * seen this, though).
 * code reference: T__ M_____.
 */</pre>

<p>This comment is in a Javascript file that implements drop-down navigation menus on a website. The code is only 170 lines long, and does nothing resembling the comment very much; it simply opens and closes the drop-down menus. It doesn&rsquo;t even add delays to the menus. The comments are completely wrong, and to add insult to injury, they scared T.M.&rsquo;s managers. After this fellow worked on our website, my manager was so afraid of it that he thought we would never be able to replace the man, and I had to literally calm him down in a meeting and explain that in fact, someone in our company <em>could</em> maintain the code, that we did <em>not</em> need to hire an outside consultant, and T.M. was <em>not</em> a &ldquo;Javascript Ninja.&rdquo; Nice going T.M.</p>

<p>I was tasked with implementing delays on the drop-down menus, and in about 90 minutes I not only did that, but I took the code down to 84 lines. T.M. had worked on this for I don&rsquo;t know how many weeks &ndash; unsuccessfully. It&rsquo;s easy to see why: he didn&rsquo;t understand what the code was doing.</p>
