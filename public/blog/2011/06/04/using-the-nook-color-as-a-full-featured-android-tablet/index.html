<p>I bought a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Barnes-Noble-Color-eBook-Tablet/dp/1400532655/?tag=xaprb-20">Barnes and Noble Nook Color</a> e-book reader and ripped out the Nook software, replacing it with the <a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.com/">CyanogenMod</a> distribution of the Android OS. It&rsquo;s really, really nice hardware, and CyanogenMod (CM) is really, really nice software. I love them both, and my regular readers will remember that I&rsquo;m <em>not a gadget guy</em>. Read on for more.</p>

<p>I never thought I&rsquo;d get a tablet, until my phone died and I got a Droid 2 as a replacement. With all those gadgets, I just started to find myself using my phone for reading my RSS feeds and so on &ndash; but hating how small the screen was. I started to think again about a tablet after experiencing how handy the smartphone&rsquo;s extra features are.</p>

<h3 id="toc_0">The Nook Color Hardware</h3>

<p>The Nook Color is a medium-sized Android tablet with a screen that&rsquo;s the same size as the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-Tab-AT-T/dp/B004CYEQF0/?tag=xaprb-20">Samsung Galaxy Tab</a>. It&rsquo;s a perfect size for carrying around &ndash; much better than iPads and Xooms and so on, which are just too big for my taste. This device literally fits in the pocket of my jeans (<a href="https://nookdeveloper.barnesandnoble.com/product/nook-color-specs.html">specs</a>).</p>

<p>The screen is amazing. It&rsquo;s super sharp. But the Nook Color doesn&rsquo;t have a microphone or a camera, and it doesn&rsquo;t have any phone service. This is fine. I don&rsquo;t want these items. I want a tablet to use primarily at home for consuming content such as blogs, books, newspapers, music, movies, and so on.</p>

<p>The best parts: 1) it&rsquo;s way cheaper than a Galaxy Tab or similar tablets. It&rsquo;s $250 at the store. And 2) it&rsquo;s really easy to take off the stripped-down version of Android that comes with it, and put something better on it. Which brings me to my next point.</p>

<h3 id="toc_1">The Software</h3>

<p>When you unpack the box, the Nook has a pretty nice little e-reader installed, with a simplified Android interface. It has limited functionality, which is fine. It does have a web browser and a couple other things, and BN recently added their own application store. But it&rsquo;s really kind of lame. You can only get a small fraction of the apps that you could get through the Android Market.</p>

<p>I updated to CyanogenMod in two stages. First, I simply rooted the device and made it possible to install arbitrary apps from the Android Market. There&rsquo;s a nice, easy process to do this. It&rsquo;s called <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=13270739&amp;#038;postcount=1">Manual Nooter</a>. I tried this first instead of just going to CyanogenMod because I wanted to see what it was like. It was okay, but it was really obvious that it was a sort of layer on top of the underlying Nook. Pressing the Home button, for example, brought up a prompt to use the Nook home screen or the hijacked home screen for the new software. I tinkered around with this for a while, enough to determine that I didn&rsquo;t like the patched look and feel. At the same time, I learned that the applications I wanted would work just fine.</p>

<p>So I moved on to CyanogenMod. Early reviews I&rsquo;d read of this said it wasn&rsquo;t ready for prime time on the Nook, but the newer updates seemed to be well received. So I backed up everything and took the plunge.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s really ridiculously easy to install CyanogenMod on the Nook, even easier if you don&rsquo;t first update your Nook operating system. It took me longer to burn a bootable ROM on a MicroSD card than anything else. Full instructions can be found beginning at <a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.com/devices/nook-color">this page</a>.</p>

<p>The result is just brilliant. I&rsquo;ve now installed my preferred apps, stripped down the interface by removing some stuff I don&rsquo;t want, such as multiple desktops (CyanogenMod is jammed with features), and I have a simple, elegant, perfectly functioning Android tablet. And I really mean it &ndash; there are no rough edges or crashes or anything you might expect from a third-party OS on your tablet. In fact, one of the things I like the most is that it doesn&rsquo;t come with pre-installed adware, as my Droid did (and the stuff on the Droid can&rsquo;t be uninstalled without rooting it and voiding the warranty, which is not something I&rsquo;m going to do on my work phone).</p>

<h3 id="toc_2">Summary</h3>

<p>If you want a small, light, thin tablet with WiFi that you can hold in one hand for reading books and newspapers and so on, which is easy to put in a pocket or purse and carry with you, and doesn&rsquo;t cost much, then consider the Nook Color. If you want to turn it into something much more full-featured, then consider ripping out the Nook software and replacing it with CyanogenMod. The result is really superb.</p>
