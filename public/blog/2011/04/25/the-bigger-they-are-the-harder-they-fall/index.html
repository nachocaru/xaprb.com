      <p>I see that a lot of people just don&rsquo;t get it when they start talking about high availability, redundancy, failover, etc. This is probably not going to change, but maybe I can try anyway.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s think about how you can survive a massive Amazon AWS failure. You build your application to automatically move services to another part of the infrastructure that&rsquo;s still up. Great! Now assume that everyone else is smart, too. Their applications move, too. What happens next?</p>

<p>The whole AWS cloud melts to the ground. Have you never seen this happen, where one instance of something fails and others pick up the load and fail in turn? I have. OK, so let&rsquo;s say that you&rsquo;re really smart, and you also have the ability to move to an entirely different provider. Now suppose that other people are smart too. Next stop &ndash; Rackspace Cloud is down, and so is Joyent, and so on.</p>

<p>You can&rsquo;t just pretend that &ldquo;the cloud&rdquo; is infinite. It isn&rsquo;t. Stop trying! In &ldquo;the cloud,&rdquo; you still have to do capacity planning, even though it&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.xaprb.com/blog/2010/06/01/under-provisioning-the-curse-of-the-cloud/">hard or impossible</a>, and you still have to think about the possibility that the resources you assume are there aren&rsquo;t. Let&rsquo;s think about cloud computing&rsquo;s older name &ndash; utility computing. Can you think of any utilities that have had capacity shortages, brownouts, or even cascading failures? I worked a bunch of case studies on them in my engineering classes, but I also lived through some of them myself.</p>

<p>This is why some old-fashioned, stupid, clueless people still own their own hardware. Those dumb clod-jumpers aren&rsquo;t hip enough to move into the cloud where everything is magical. I bet they have kerosene lanterns for when the lights go out, too.</p>

<p>With economies of scale come failures at scale. You can&rsquo;t have it both ways.</p>
