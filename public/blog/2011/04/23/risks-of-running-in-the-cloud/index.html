      <p>I think we&rsquo;re beginning to see cloud computing mature a little bit. There is a long ways to go, but I am detecting more sober thinking on a wider scale. The events of last week, where many people were affected by Amazon&rsquo;s outages, are helping clues sink in a little bit.</p>

<p>There are a lot of risks that don&rsquo;t go away when you use cloud platforms. There are a lot of new risks that you&rsquo;ll encounter. And yes, some problems are outsourced. But clear-headed thinking on &ldquo;what is cloud computing about and what is it good for?&rdquo; is still largely nonexistent on a broad scale. The din of the hype machine has most IT folks&rsquo;s heads ringing and they can&rsquo;t think straight.</p>

<p>Is that an over-generalization? I don&rsquo;t think so. Go look at Twitter and I think you&rsquo;ll see a pretty good representation of the general state of people&rsquo;s thought processes around cloud computing. You can look at the four-page special advertising spreads and pull-out sections in the Wall Street Journal for the source of the confusion. A recent pull-out section told me that cloud computing is going to revolutionize even the nursery &ndash; who wants a baby monitor when you could have a laptop sitting in your nursery with a webcam watching the babies? That was over the top, but not too far. Most of what&rsquo;s written about &ldquo;cloud computing&rdquo; is both ridiculously hyped and completely off-topic; writers will slap &ldquo;cloud&rdquo; on anything tech-related to get eyeballs on it. And that&rsquo;s causing a general muddiness of the waters.</p>

<p>But this week, I heard some people thinking about questions like &ldquo;if I rely on an external services provider for something, and there is an emergency that affects a lot of their customers, will I have to wait in line to get help for my own systems?&rdquo; That&rsquo;s sober thinking. We need more of that. A monoculture of any type is a problem. If I were building something on a cloud platform, I&rsquo;d ensure that it was diversified not just across availability zones, but across completely different providers.</p>

<p>This is one reason why we need standardized APIs for managing cloud resources, but that&rsquo;s a digression.</p>
