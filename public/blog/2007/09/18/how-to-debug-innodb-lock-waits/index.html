<p>This article shows you how to use a little-known InnoDB feature to find out what is holding the lock for which an InnoDB transaction is waiting. I then show you how to use an undocumented feature to make this even easier with <a href="http://code.google.com/p/innotop/">innotop</a>.</p>

<h3 id="toc_0">Background</h3>

<p>One of the most common complaints I&rsquo;ve heard from DBAs used to other database servers is &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t find out who holds the locks that are blocking all these connections and making them time out.&rdquo; I feel your pain. Before I helped scale my employer&rsquo;s systems to deal with larger volumes of data, InnoDB lock contention was a serious issue. And as far as I knew, you couldn&rsquo;t find out who was holding locks. I knew you could see who was <em>waiting for locks to be granted</em>; that&rsquo;s easy. You just run <code>SHOW INNODB STATUS</code> and look for the following text:</p>

<pre>------------
TRANSACTIONS
------------
Trx id counter 0 4874
Purge done for trx's n:o &lt; 0 4869 undo n:o &lt; 0 0
History list length 21
Total number of lock structs in row lock hash table 2
LIST OF TRANSACTIONS FOR EACH SESSION:
---TRANSACTION 0 4873, ACTIVE 6 sec, process no 7142, OS thread id 1141152064 starting index read
mysql tables in use 1, locked 1
<strong>LOCK WAIT</strong> 2 lock struct(s), heap size 368
MySQL thread id 9, query id 173 localhost root Sending data
select * from t1 for update
------- <strong>TRX HAS BEEN WAITING 6 SEC FOR THIS LOCK TO BE GRANTED</strong>:
RECORD LOCKS space id 9 page no 3 n bits 72 index `PRIMARY` of table `test/t1` trx id 0 4873 lock_mode X waiting
...</pre>

<p>That&rsquo;s fine, but who holds the lock? I thought there was no way to find that out.</p>

<h3 id="toc_1">InnoDB Lock Monitor</h3>

<p>Until I learned about the <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/en/innodb-monitor.html">InnoDB Lock Monitor</a>, that is. You enable it by running the following command:</p>

<pre>CREATE TABLE innodb_lock_monitor(a int) ENGINE=INNODB;</pre>

<p>It&rsquo;s quite an ugly hack, but it turns out the table name is actually &ldquo;magical.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a special table name that tells InnoDB to start the lock monitor. You can stop it by dropping the table again.</p>

<p>This little-noticed feature makes InnoDB print out a slightly modified version of what you see with <code>SHOW INNODB STATUS</code>. The &ldquo;slight modification&rdquo; is to print out not only the locks the transaction waits for, but also those it <em>holds</em>. For example, here&rsquo;s the transaction that holds the locks:</p>

<pre>---TRANSACTION 0 4872, ACTIVE 32 sec, process no 7142, OS thread id 1141287232
2 lock struct(s), heap size 368
MySQL thread id 8, query id 164 localhost root
<strong>TABLE LOCK table `test/t1` trx id 0 4872 lock mode IX
RECORD LOCKS space id 9 page no 3 n bits 72 index `PRIMARY` of table `test/t1` trx id 0 4872 lock_mode X</strong>
Record lock, heap no 1 PHYSICAL RECORD: n_fields 1; compact format; info bits 0
 0: len 8; hex 73757072656d756d; asc supremum;;

Record lock, heap no 2 PHYSICAL RECORD: n_fields 3; compact format; info bits 0
 0: len 4; hex 80000001; asc     ;; 1: len 6; hex 000000000d35; asc      5;; 2: len 7; hex 800000002d0110; asc     -  ;;</pre>

<p>That&rsquo;s fine, but there are, ah, limitations. As the manual says, InnoDB periodically prints out this text &ndash; essentially spewing InnoDB&rsquo;s guts &ndash; to its standard output. This gets redirected to the server error log in any sane installation. Who&rsquo;s looking there? And it gets printed out at long intervals, which seems to be about every 16 seconds on the machines I use.</p>

<p>Plus, if you&rsquo;ve looked at the result, you&rsquo;ll understand this is not something you want to search through manually looking for data. The output can be absolutely huge. What DBA wants to pore over thousands of hex-dumped rows from the table just to answer the question &ldquo;who holds that lock?&rdquo;</p>

<p>All in all, this is not very convenient (yep, I know that&rsquo;s an understatement).</p>

<h3 id="toc_2">Slightly more convenient</h3>

<p>What&rsquo;s a little more convenient than combing through all that text by hand is writing a program to parse InnoDB&rsquo;s status output. You don&rsquo;t have to, though. That&rsquo;s what I wrote innotop to do. And I&rsquo;ve just released version 1.5.2, which at long last has the ability to watch a log file as well as connecting to server(s).</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how this works: you start innotop, and press the L key to switch to Lock mode. This replaces the old Lock Wait mode, which was only able to monitor the InnoDB lock waits you see in the normal output of <code>SHOW INNODB STATUS</code>.</p>

<p>This mode shows you something like the following:</p>

<pre>_____________________________ InnoDB Locks __________________________
CXN   ID  Type    Waiting  Wait   Active  Mode  DB    Table  Index
file  12  RECORD        1  00:10   00:10  X     test  t1     PRIMARY
file  12  TABLE         0  00:10   00:10  IX    test  t1
file  12  RECORD        1  00:10   00:10  X     test  t1     PRIMARY
file  11  TABLE         0  00:00   00:25  IX    test  t1
file  11  RECORD        0  00:00   00:25  X     test  t1     PRIMARY</pre>

<p>That&rsquo;s helpful! I can see the locks held and waited for in a nice tabular format. It&rsquo;s pretty easy to see connection 11 is blocking connection 12.</p>

<p>This is still pretty inconvenient, though. To get access to the server&rsquo;s error log, I have to run innotop on the database server machine itself. Is there a better way?</p>

<h3 id="toc_3">Even better</h3>

<p>There is, in fact, but I discovered it completely by accident. It&rsquo;s not documented, but the extra information doesn&rsquo;t just get printed to the server log. It also shows up in <code>SHOW INNODB STATUS</code>! Now that&rsquo;s a nice surprise. It means innotop can get lock information from a normal connection instead of monitoring a log file.</p>

<p>After discovering this, I immediately added some more features to innotop. There are now hot-keys in L mode to enable and disable the lock monitor. Now you can press L, press the &lsquo;a&rsquo; key to start the lock monitor, see what&rsquo;s blocking the waiting transaction, press &lsquo;o&rsquo; to stop the lock monitor, and you&rsquo;re done.</p>

<h3 id="toc_4">Best yet</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure you InnoDB administrators already recognize what an improvement this is over the options you previously had (essentially, you didn&rsquo;t have any). There&rsquo;s still a long way to go, though. Locks could be in the <code>INFORMATION_SCHEMA</code> or in a <code>SHOW LOCKS</code> command. I won&rsquo;t speculate on why they aren&rsquo;t already.</p>

<p>Of course, the upcoming Falcon storage engine already has better features for debugging lock contention than this. But my guess is it&rsquo;ll be a long time before Falcon has the market share InnoDB has. All things considered, InnoDB is a pretty nice piece of software.</p>

<h3 id="toc_5">Conclusion</h3>

<p>The conclusion to this whole article is: use <a href="http://code.google.com/p/innotop/">innotop</a> if you use InnoDB. Heck, use it if you use MySQL at all. It makes a lot of things a lot easier, not just debugging InnoDB lock contention. Feedback is welcome &ndash; just use the Sourceforge bug tracker, forums, and mailing lists.</p>
