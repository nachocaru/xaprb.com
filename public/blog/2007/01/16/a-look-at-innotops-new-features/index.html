<p>I just made a snapshot of the development branch of the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/innotop/">innotop</a> MySQL and InnoDB monitor, and released it as version 1.3.0. This code will eventually become version 1.4. Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s new.</p>

<h3 id="toc_0">Version number policy</h3>

<p>Odd-numbered releases, such as 1.3.0, contain the code that will eventually become a stable release &ndash; in this case 1.4. Not all the features are there, and not all of them work perfectly, but it&rsquo;s a development snapshot for community review and feedback. That said, there&rsquo;s no dangerous code here, just the possibility of crashes.</p>

<h3 id="toc_1">Major new features</h3>

<p>The development branch of innotop is geared towards the eventual goal of monitoring a large number of servers at once. While there is much work to be done, the new features are a significant step towards the goal, in my opinion. With innotop 1.3.0 you can monitor multiple servers, organize them into groups, and switch between groups easily. If you don&rsquo;t have that many servers to monitor, and don&rsquo;t need to group them together, just press <code>@</code> to define and choose among server connections. If you&rsquo;re interested in grouping servers together, take a look at what the <code>#</code> and <code>TAB</code> keys do.</p>

<p>Monitoring lots of servers at once makes life much easier if you manage a lot of machines that are involved in replication. To that end, I&rsquo;ve also added a new mode to monitor master and slave status. You can see master and slave status in the same view; by default the data is grouped into slave SQL status, slave I/O status, and master status. This gives you a quick glance at whether the slaves are running, how far they lag the master, and so forth. Press <code>M</code> to enter this mode.</p>

<p>As always, you can press <code>?</code> at any time for context-sensitive help on these and other features.</p>

<p>You can use innotop in command-line scripting now. The command-line options are limited at this time, but I hope to get more feedback on the best way to do things before putting a lot more work into it. Right now, you can specify a config file from which innotop will determine what output to create. The output is tab-separated, and can be piped into <code>awk</code> or other command-line utilities for further processing.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also put a lot of work into making it easier to use innotop. There&rsquo;s readline support to help you type the right thing (I recommend installing Term::ReadLine::Gnu for best performance). There&rsquo;s a new &ldquo;table editor&rdquo; which allows you to determine which columns you want in the output. Press <code>^</code> to start the table editor.</p>

<p>While I&rsquo;ve done a lot towards usability, some of the new features are still a bit rough. For example, user-defined expressions can now be the source of a column in the output, much like a spreadsheet. Suppose you want a column that shows the queries per second in the output; you can divide the queries by the uptime to get this. However, these expressions are basically Perl subroutines, so they&rsquo;re probably not that useful to you at the moment, unless you know Perl. Likewise, you can do more complex filtering on the output, but you&rsquo;re in Perl-land again. Over time I plan to make this more friendly.</p>

<p>I am trying to strike a balance between usability and learnability (yep, I&rsquo;ve been reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1893115941?ie=UTF8&amp;#038;tag=xaprb-20&amp;#038;link_code=as3&amp;#038;camp=211189&amp;#038;creative=373489&amp;#038;creativeASIN=1893115941">Joel Spolsky&rsquo;s book on user-interface design</a>). I primarily intend for innotop to be a power-user tool. If you&rsquo;re not a power-user, you probably don&rsquo;t need it. However, I do want to make sure it is learnable, and I don&rsquo;t want to ignore users who just have one server to monitor. You can help by telling me what you think.</p>

<h3 id="toc_2">What&rsquo;s next</h3>

<p>I plan to finish fixing the things I&rsquo;ve broken, polish off the new features, and finish the documentation before I slap a 1.4 label on the code and release it again. In the meantime I may make more incremental releases. This process will take me a little while, as I have several other projects I need to finish before I spend another large chunk of my spare time on innotop (I have spent a lot of time on it over the holidays).</p>

<p>You can download the new releases from <a href="http://code.google.com/p/innotop/">sourceforge</a> when they&rsquo;re made. Initially a tar.gz and a zip file will always be made available; hopefully Debian and Ubuntu packages will follow soon after.</p>

<p>Stay tuned!</p>
