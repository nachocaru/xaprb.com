<p>A couple of weeks ago I submitted a request to open a new project on Sourceforge for the innotop MySQL and InnoDB monitor. I want to make it easier for others to collaborate, especially package maintainers. Yesterday I got word of its approval. I have done a quick-and-dirty import of the source code into its new home, and I&rsquo;m now continuing work on the next major version, which I&rsquo;ve been working on for about six weeks. This post is about Sourceforge, what I&rsquo;ve gotten done, and also to ask for your help.</p>

<h3 id="toc_0">innotop&rsquo;s new home on Sourceforge</h3>

<p>The new project homepage is <a href="http://code.google.com/p/innotop/">http://code.google.com/p/innotop/</a>. Thus far all I have done is add the code to the Subversion repository.</p>

<p>I branched off from the last major release, what used to be called 0.1.162. This will become version 1.0 when I get a chance to make a package. I will probably not do a whole lot more on it; there is a bug fix or two to apply, and I&rsquo;ll apply bug fixes going forward, but I don&rsquo;t plan any major new features.</p>

<p>After branching, I slammed six weeks&rsquo; worth of changes into one revision in the trunk. This will become 2.0 eventually.</p>

<h3 id="toc_1">What&rsquo;s done so far</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve lost track, actually, but here are some of the things I&rsquo;ve gotten done.</p>

<ul>
<li>Readline support.</li>
<li>Monitor multiple servers simultaneously.</li>
<li>Monitor master/slave status and control slaves.</li>
<li>Columns can have user-defined expressions as their data sources.</li>
<li>Better configuration tools.</li>
<li>InnoDB status information is merged into <code>SHOW VARIABLES</code> and <code>SHOW STATUS</code> information, so you can access it all together.</li>
<li>High-precision time support in more places.</li>
<li>Lots of tweaks to make things display more readably and compactly.</li>
<li>A ton of cleanup and rewriting to enable all this.</li>
</ul>

<p>I know that&rsquo;s not the whole list. That can&rsquo;t be half of it. Oh well, read the commit messages if you want the whole story!</p>

<h3 id="toc_2">What&rsquo;s to do</h3>

<p>There&rsquo;s a fairly manageable to-do list at this point, but it will still take me a while. I want to add some more features, such as highlighting rows when they meet some criteria, sorting by multiple columns, more built-in configuration editing stuff, unattended output for processing by other scripts, and so forth.</p>

<p>One major change I&rsquo;ll need to make at some point is multi-threading. For ease of development, at this time everything is single-threaded, but this becomes problematic when monitoring multiple servers.</p>

<p>I am implementing the features I want. Mostly. If you tell me what you want, I&rsquo;ll do my best. I don&rsquo;t often hear requests from users, but so far I&rsquo;ve been able to fulfill every one. Most recently, I heard from a user whose terminal freaks out when it displays queries that have gzipped binary garble, so I wrote functionality to parse out quote-delimited strings and replace them with the text [BINARY] if they contain non-printable characters.</p>

<h3 id="toc_3">How you can help</h3>

<p>Certain parts of this work are easy for me. I like programming. I am decent with Perl. I know MySQL pretty well. I can write innotop (though if you want to help, by all means go ahead).</p>

<p>But I&rsquo;m new to this whole thing of &ldquo;running an open-source software project.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t even know how to write a Makefile. I don&rsquo;t have time or know-how to build Debian packages and RPMs, or even maintain the spec files. Heck, until a few days ago I didn&rsquo;t even know how to branch (oh, I knew in theory, and I knew what commands to use, but I didn&rsquo;t know &ldquo;how it&rsquo;s done&rdquo;). Some of you have stepped in and helped, and I appreciate it. But there&rsquo;s more to do.</p>

<p>Sourceforge gives the project a website, bug tracker, forums and mailing lists. I don&rsquo;t have time to manage a website, a forum or a mailing list. I&rsquo;ll take on the bug tracker if no one else will, but as far as I&rsquo;m concerned these four jobs are open to anyone who wants to take them.</p>

<p>Sourceforge also provides a release management system. I&rsquo;d love it if I could just tell someone &ldquo;hey, X is stable now, time to make packages&rdquo; and go back to programming.</p>

<p>Most importantly, there&rsquo;s a real need for documentation. It&rsquo;s getting more complicated to use innotop, and there&rsquo;s no real guide telling people how to do it. People email me asking for features I&rsquo;ve already built. (Sometimes I can&rsquo;t even remember having built them, but don&rsquo;t publish that, okay?)</p>

<p>If you want to do any of this, email me. I&rsquo;m the project admin on Sourceforge, so all I have to do is give your Sourceforge account permission, and you can jump right in and help. I am <em>not</em> a micro-manager, so if you say you want to help, I&rsquo;ll give you whatever permissions you need.</p>

<h3 id="toc_4">The future</h3>

<p>I fully intend to support anything that fits into innotop&rsquo;s model of doing things, for whatever the MySQL community needs it for, within my time and ability constraints. That means if telcos want it to manage NDB clusters, I&rsquo;ll do that. If SolidDB or Falcon or PBXT expose internals for monitoring, I&rsquo;ll add in hooks for that. I&rsquo;ve long ago contacted them and asked them to consider exposing such internals in a friendly way that doesn&rsquo;t require string-parsing like InnoDB.</p>

<p>Most importantly from my perspective, I&rsquo;m using it every day to monitor and manage the systems at work, and I&rsquo;m not done making it easy yet. Whatever causes me trouble is going to get attention.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s to a great 2007!</p>
