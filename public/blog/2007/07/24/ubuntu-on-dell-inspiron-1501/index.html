  <h1>Ubuntu on Dell Inspiron 1501</h1>

      <p>I recently bought a Dell Inspiron 1501, which I got a great deal on thanks to the fine people at <a href="http://www.dealnews.com/">DealNews</a>. The base system was $449 shipped, and I chose to upgrade the processor to dual AMD64s. But I didn&rsquo;t buy the system that came with Ubuntu pre-installed; for whatever reason, the one that came with Windows offered a special discount (normally the Windows tax for otherwise identical machines appears to be around $150, and I&rsquo;m certainly not going to run Windows).</p>

<p>Therefore, I was not sure Ubuntu would support all the hardware. It&rsquo;s the same story it&rsquo;s been for as long as I&rsquo;ve been using computers: hardware manufacturers withhold specifications from the Free Software world, so there is always a chance something will be a trouble. The good news is, I&rsquo;ve only noticed two very minor incompatibilities out of the box.</p>

<p>One is that the Fn+arrow keys won&rsquo;t change my screen brightness, at least under XFCE. Strangely, my ancient Dell laptop had no trouble with that. I assume the old one was a hardware-controlled feature and this one needs some software support, but I could be wrong.</p>

<p>The other thing is the built-in wireless card, which isn&rsquo;t supported with Ubuntu 7.04&#8242;s drivers out of the box. However, I quickly found a set of <a href="http://www.linux-geek.org/index.php/2007/04/22/dell-1390-native-linux-driver-how-to-updated">drivers for the Broadcom Corporation Dell Wireless 1390</a> card, and was up and running shortly thereafter. The only thing I had to do after installing the drivers was press the Fn+F2 key, which turns the card on.</p>

<p>Otherwise everything works brilliantly.</p>

<p>And now for a rant: click through to that page about the drivers, and you&rsquo;ll see an example of what I consider the Ubuntu sudo disease. There&rsquo;s even a screenshot of someone typing <code>sudo uname -a</code> and using sudo to remove a file he didn&rsquo;t create with sudo. I think unfortunately, Ubuntu&rsquo;s policy of allowing one to run any command with sudo has created a crop of people who don&rsquo;t understand what should and shouldn&rsquo;t be privileged; some of them seem to believe that &lsquo;sudo&rsquo; is what you type at the beginning of every command. It completely defeats the purpose and circumvents the security gained by not running as root. For my part, when I want to administer my system, I become root, do what I need to do, and then quit again. I rarely sudo any command other than <code>sudo su -</code>.</p>

<p>But that&rsquo;s just me.</p>
