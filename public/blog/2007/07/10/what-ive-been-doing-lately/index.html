  <h1>What I&#39;ve been doing lately</h1>

      <p>I haven&rsquo;t been blogging about the things I used to &ndash; how-tos and technical hacks &ndash; because I&rsquo;ve been working quite hard on <a href="http://code.google.com/p/maatkit/">MySQL Toolkit</a> and, believe it or not, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/innotop/projects/innotop/">innotop</a>. I&rsquo;ve made it possible to write innotop plugins, which have been very useful to our team at work, and I&rsquo;m working on documentation. Plugins won&rsquo;t make it into the upcoming release; it&rsquo;ll just be bug fixes and documentation. These projects have taken up most of my free time.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also tentatively joined a group of people working on a very large, exciting, secret project which may consume the rest of my summer and/or much of the rest of the year. (I&rsquo;ve been turning down consulting gigs and other projects because of this). If this secret project works out, I&rsquo;ll be writing more about it here, you can count on that.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I&rsquo;m still planning to finish some of the work I&rsquo;ve started on MySQL Table Sync, which I continue to need because of a replication bug I haven&rsquo;t been able to isolate.</p>

<p>Someday, maybe even soon, I might finish some of my 60+ drafts, such as &ldquo;how to implement event listeners and notification in MySQL.&rdquo; But I think the other projects I&rsquo;m working on are much more important and beneficial to many more people, so I have prioritized them.</p>

<p>I had a slight glitch with my <a href="http://www.xaprb.com/blog/donate/">Amazon wishlist</a>. I was on vacation and when I came back, I saw about half a dozen things purchased from it, but I haven&rsquo;t received any of them (thank you, whoever you are!). I didn&rsquo;t really understand how the wish list worked, so I didn&rsquo;t know I needed to specify a shipping address. I assumed Amazon would send them to my primary shipping address. Well, apparently that didn&rsquo;t work, and in the meantime I also realized Amazon was sending mail somewhere I couldn&rsquo;t receive it, so I&rsquo;m not sure what is really going on. I&rsquo;ve specified an address now, and I&rsquo;m hoping that takes care of it.</p>
