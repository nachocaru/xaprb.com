  <h1 class="post-title">More GnuCash to MySQL tools and queries</h1>

<p>I wrote a while ago about a program I wrote to <a href="/blog/2006/03/12/gnucash-to-mysql-export-script/">export GnuCash data into a MySQL database</a>, including a couple of queries against the resulting schema. I&rsquo;ve made some improvements since then to allow a simple overlay of my wife&rsquo;s categories onto the GnuCash hierarchy. This article explains the improved schema, and includes some more useful tools and queries.</p>

<h3 id="toc_0">The improved schema</h3>

<p>The heart of the schema that holds the GnuCash data remains the same, but I&rsquo;ve added a table to overlay our categorization system onto it. The fundamental issue is the old multiple-hierarchy problem: some transactions should live in different places in the GnuCash account hierarchy than they belong in our expense summary. To remedy this, I just created a table to define our own categories. The resulting system is very simple, and defines a single level of hierarchy, where everything is at the top level; there are no nested categories (though you can simulate nested categories with a naming convention, such as &ldquo;Auto:Repair&rdquo;).</p>

<p>This system is about as simple as possible. Here&rsquo;s the query to create the new table:</p>

<pre>create table account_category (
   account char(31) not null primary key,
   category char(20)
) ENGINE=InnoDB;</pre>

<p>It would be more normalized to place this data in the <code>account</code> table itself, but that makes it too easy to wipe out your category data when you recreate the schema. For that reason I decided to separate the account and its category.</p>

<h3 id="toc_1">Category setup</h3>

<p>There&rsquo;s a required initial setup before this is usable, of course: you have to define the categories and associate accounts with them. To ease this step, you should go through your GnuCash file and check the &ldquo;placeholder&rdquo; properties checkbox for any accounts you know only exist to hold other accounts. This way you won&rsquo;t have to worry about assigning them to categories. If you do this, you should run <code>gnucash2mysql</code> to re-create the schema and re-import the data.</p>

<p>Next, run the included <code>setup-categories.pl</code> script. It will ask you to enter a category name for each unassigned account. It prints the account hierarchy so you can easily tell what the account is. If you want to leave an account un-categorized, just press Enter and it&rsquo;ll be skipped.</p>

<p>The categorization requires that you understand the double-entry accounting principles on which GnuCash is built. The updated queries I&rsquo;ve included in the download will include transaction splits that transfer money both <strong>into and out of</strong> a GnuCash account, so think about that as you assign the categories. For example, our GnuCash account &ldquo;Bills:Groceries&rdquo; is associated with &ldquo;Groceries.&rdquo; When there is a transaction involving &ldquo;Bills:Groceries,&rdquo; the money has to come from somewhere &ndash; our checking account, for example. We don&rsquo;t want to include the checking account in any categories, or that money will get counted twice &ndash; once as it leaves the checking account, once as it enters the &ldquo;Bills::Groceries&rdquo; expense account. This is the fundamental simplification I made to create a non-double-entry report of what we spend. On the other hand, maybe you want to do it differently. Suit yourself :-)</p>

<h3 id="toc_2">When you&rsquo;re done</h3>

<p>When you&rsquo;re done associating categories with accounts, you will find new queries in the package for your enjoyment.</p>

<h3 id="toc_3">Miscellaneous improvements</h3>

<p>In the time since I first wrote this program I&rsquo;ve realized the benefits of using Perl libraries that are already installed on most systems. I&rsquo;ve gotten rid of the dependencies on non-standard libraries in the new versions. That change should make the scripts easier to install and use. The scripts also read your .my.cnf file if it exists, so you don&rsquo;t have to specify MySQL options.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, these little scripts and queries are about having more than one way to do things. I hope you find them useful.</p>
