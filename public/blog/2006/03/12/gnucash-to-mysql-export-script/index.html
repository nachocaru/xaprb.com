  <h1>GnuCash to MySQL export script</h1>

<p>It&rsquo;s tax season, and this year I decided to export my GnuCash data into a MySQL database for analysis. This article is about that process, including source code for the export script and a couple of simple queries.</p>

<p>The source code is available <a href="https://github.com/xaprb/gnucash2mysql">on GitHub</a>.</p>

<h3 id="toc_0">The script</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.gnucash.org">GnuCash</a> is a powerful double-entry accounting system for managing personal and/or business finances. I&rsquo;ve used it since about 2002, and find it adequate for my needs. However, the reporting is widely acknowledged to be one of its weakest points. Reporting is implemented in the <a href="http://www.swiss.ai.mit.edu/projects/scheme/">Scheme programming language</a>, and if the included reports aren&rsquo;t enough, most people probably won&rsquo;t be able to write their own. Personally, I find it much easier (for certain reports) to write SQL queries instead. With that in mind, I set out to write a little script that will insert my GnuCash data into a MySQL database.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s actually a fairly simple task; the GnuCash developers chose XML as the file format, so the data is easily accessible from other programs. I decided to export only the account structure and transactions, leaving alone the business features such as customers and invoices.</p>

<p>Before I started, though, I spent some time investigating the built-in PostgreSQL backend. The default data format is XML, but the GnuCash developers also have support for storing the data in a <a href="http://www.postgresql.org">PostgreSQL</a> database. Unfortunately, I couldn&rsquo;t get it to work. At least in version 1.8.11, it seems to be broken. In fact, the GnuCash website and developer mailing lists indicate this is a low priority for right now, as they are working towards a new version which uses an updated graphical toolkit (<a href="http://www.gtk.org">GTK+</a>). Apparently the source is high-quality, but a bit out of date since the developers plan to revisit that once the new version is ready.</p>

<p>Satisfied that I&rsquo;m not reinventing the wheel, I went ahead with a script to export the data myself. Since the XML format is really straightforward, I decided to do the simplest thing I could get to work. Perl seemed like a good choice. I am familiar with <a href="http://expat.sourceforge.net">expat</a>, and Perl has an expat module, so that was also a natural choice for the XML parsing. The basic idea is to push the data through the script like drinking from a firehose, and when it detects certain things &ndash; the start of an element, some character data, the end of an element &ndash; call a function to handle the data. Depending on what the data is (what element I&rsquo;m currently examining, etc) I either store it for later reference, or push it into the database. I also automated creating the necessary table structure in the database.</p>

<p>Access to a MySQL database is required. The script uses tables called account, transaction and split. The DDL used to create the tables is at the end of the Perl script file. I used InnoDB tables so I&rsquo;d have transaction support.</p>

<p>The script requires these Perl modules: DBI, Term::ProgressBar, and XML::Parser::Expat. You can run it with the <code>--help</code> option to see how to run it.</p>

<h3 id="toc_1">The queries</h3>

<p>These queries assume precision decimal math. Versions of MySQL less than 5.0 use imprecise math. I wrote an article on <a href="http://www.xaprb.com/blog/2006/03/08/decimal-math-in-mysql/">MySQL and decimal math</a>. If you have any issues with these queries, it may help to consult that article.</p>

<p>This query finds all unbalanced non-equity transactions by summing the splits:</p>

<pre>select
    s.amount,
    a.name,
    t.description,
    t.posted
from account as a
    inner join (
        select transaction, sum(amount) as amount, max(account) as account
        from split
        group by transaction
        having sum(amount) &lt;&gt; 0
    ) as s on s.account = a.id
    inner join transaction as t on t.id = s.transaction
where a.type &lt;&gt; 'EQUITY'</pre>

<p>This query sums all expenses for 2005 by month and account:</p>

<pre>select date_format(posted, '%Y-%m') as month, name, sum(amount) as amount
from transaction as t
    inner join split as s on s.transaction = t.id
    inner join (
        select id, name from account
            where type='EXPENSE'
    ) as a on a.id = s.account
where year(posted) = 2005
group by date_format(posted, '%Y-%m'), name
order by date_format(posted, '%Y-%m'), name;</pre>

<p>This query finds average monthly expenditures by account since January 2005:</p>

<pre>select @num_months := count(distinct date_format(posted, '%Y-%m'))
    from transaction
    where posted &gt;= '2005-01-01';

select cast(sum(amount) / @num_months as decimal(8,2)) as 'Average monthly amount',
    concat(coalesce(grandparent_name, ''),
        if(grandparent_name is null, '', ' &gt; '),
        coalesce(parent_name, ''),
        if(parent_name is null, '', ' &gt; '),
        name) as name
from (
    select date_format(posted, '%Y-%m') as month,
        a.name,
        aa.name as parent_name,
        aaa.name as grandparent_name,
        sum(amount) as amount
    from transaction as t
        inner join split as s on s.transaction = t.id
        inner join (
            select id, name, parent from account
            where type='EXPENSE'
        ) as a on a.id = s.account
        left outer join account as aa on aa.id = a.parent
        left outer join account as aaa on aaa.id = aa.parent
    where posted &gt;= '2005-01-01'
    group by date_format(posted, '%Y-%m'), a.name
) as x
group by name
order by name;</pre>
