<p>Most operating systems have an auto-mount feature to detect and mount devices, such as USB flash drives, when they&rsquo;re plugged in. GNU/Linux is no exception. It&rsquo;s easy to install and just as easy to use. In this article I&rsquo;ll show you how to get auto-mounting without changing <code>/etc/fstab</code>, writing udev rules, or installing a huge desktop environment such as Gnome or KDE.</p>

<h3 id="toc_0">There&rsquo;s more than one way to do it</h3>

<p>There are lots of ways to get things auto-mounted. I&rsquo;ve browsed around the Gentoo forums, and I see dozens of ways people do it. Some people write <code>udev</code> rules to recognize devices. Others write custom shell scripts, tinker with <code>/etc/fstab</code>, or do a combination of lots of things. Probably the most common methods, though, are to use the built-in functionality that comes with the KDE or Gnome desktop environments &ndash; or to use the software <em>they</em> use, but not use the desktop environment itself.</p>

<p>Gnome uses <code>gnome-volume-manager</code> and <code>gnome-volume-properties</code> to auto-mount devices, and when appropriate runs a program, such as a <code>gphoto2</code> in the case of a digital camera. I&rsquo;m not sure exactly how KDE does automounting, since I haven&rsquo;t used it in many years. What I am fairly sure of is that they both use the same programs to get their work done under the hood. These programs are <code>hal</code> (the Hardware Abstraction Layer), <code>dbus</code> (a system message bus), and <code>udev</code> (userspace device filesystems).</p>

<p>In my opinion, some methods are definitely easier than others. I suggest you either install Gnome or KDE, or if you&rsquo;re a minimalist like myself, just install a system that doesn&rsquo;t require a huge set of dependencies.</p>

<h3 id="toc_1">Using Gnome</h3>

<p>If you&rsquo;re running Gnome, or if you have it installed but run another desktop environment, such as XFCE, you need <code>gnome-volume-manager</code> to be running. Gnome usually starts it automatically. If you use another desktop environment, you need to start it so it runs in the background. For example, you could put this in your <code>.xinitrc</code>file:</p>

<pre>gnome-volume-manager &
startxfce4</pre>

<p>That starts it running in the background, then starts XFCE.</p>

<p>Once you&rsquo;ve got it running, you can run <code>gnome-volume-properties</code> to configure what it should do when it detects and mounts a volume. It can run programs, open a file browser, and so forth.</p>

<h3 id="toc_2">My favorite method</h3>

<p>I prefer not to use <code>gnome-volume-manager</code>. For one thing, it requires an X server to be running, so it won&rsquo;t work if I don&rsquo;t want to start a windowing environment. Sometimes I just want to log in and work at the command line. It also requires me to install tons of other &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; I just don&rsquo;t really need. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I think Gnome is nice. I just think less is more.</p>

<p>So, I prefer to run software that does nothing but sit in the background waiting to be notified that something has been plugged in. The <code>ivman</code> program does that very nicely, and it&rsquo;s very small.</p>

<p>For this to work, it needs the same things Gnome relies on: <code>hal</code>, <code>dbus</code>, and <code>udev</code>. All three need to be running as daemons. If you&rsquo;re using Gentoo, you almost certainly have udev already, since it&rsquo;s been part of the standard installation instructions for years. Other distributions should have udev as well. Installing <code>hal</code> through your distribution&rsquo;s package management system should install <code>dbus</code> as a dependency. Likewise, starting the <code>hald</code> daemon should start <code>dbus</code> as a dependency. In Gentoo, installing <code>ivman</code> will install these as dependencies, so it&rsquo;s as easy as</p>

<pre>tigger ~ # emerge ivman
tigger ~ # rc-update add hald default</pre>

<p>Now all the software I need is installed, and <code>hald</code> and <code>dbus</code> will start when the computer boots. All that remains is to give myself the proper permissions, and start <code>ivman</code>. As root, I can run <code>vigr</code> or use <code>usermod</code> to make myself a member of the <code>plugdev</code> group. I need to log out and back in for this to take effect. To start <code>ivman</code> automatically, I can add it to the end of my <code>.bashrc</code> file:</p>

<pre>ivman --nofork &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&1 &</pre>

<p>Now I&rsquo;m done. When I plug a device in, <code>ivman</code> finds it and mounts it (actually, it can do a lot more than just mount it; read the man page). I have the permissions I need to change files on the device and unmount it again. It appears under <code>http://www.xaprb.com/media</code>. If I&rsquo;m running a file manager such as Nautilus, it shows up on the desktop and in the left-hand pane of the browser view, and I can unmount it with a right-click.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m running <code>ivman</code> as myself, not system-wide. There are security and convenience reasons for doing so. The man page explains more about it. It can also automatically run itself as a daemon in the background, but I&rsquo;m choosing not to do that so a) it quits when I log out for security, and b) I don&rsquo;t get multiple instances running when I log in and out repeatedly.</p>

<h3 id="toc_3">Summary</h3>

<p>I recommend one of two methods:</p>

<ol>
<li>Use Gnome or KDE</li>
<li>Install <code>ivman</code>, make yourself a member of the <code>plugdev</code> group, and start <code>ivman</code> from your <code>.bashrc</code></li>
</ol>

<p>So that&rsquo;s it, it just works. I hope this helps you avoid a bunch of hacking, <code>udev</code> rules, and shell scripts.</p>
