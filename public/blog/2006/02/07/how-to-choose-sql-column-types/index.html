<p>There are at least two important factors to consider when choosing a column type for a <acronym title="Relational database query language">SQL</acronym> database table: technical requirements and semantics. The choice can be confusing, but it is important to get it right. I&rsquo;ve seen it done both ways and it&rsquo;s sometimes hard to tell what&rsquo;s wrong &ndash; it just feels wrong. In this article I will explain how to spot these mistakes, and more importantly, how to explain the mistake clearly to others.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll assume the data requirements are already known &ndash; in other words, I have all the information I need to decide what type of data will live in the column.</p>

<h3 id="toc_0">Technical considerations</h3>

<p>Technical considerations are often the first thing many technical people think about when choosing a column type. This is natural; technical prowess is a core strength, so there can sometimes be a tendency to make it the most important factor, or even the <strong>only</strong> factor, in the decision. Resist that tendency!</p>

<p>That said, it&rsquo;s important to consider the storage requirements, indexing characteristics, foreign key relationships and so forth when choosing a column type. Most <acronym title="Relational database management system">RDBMS</acronym>s have extensive documentation about choosing column types. Any specific suggestion other than &ldquo;consult your documentation&rdquo; is beyond this article&rsquo;s scope! If you&rsquo;re not intimately familiar with your <acronym title="Relational database management system">RDBMS</acronym>, you might also consider getting help from someone who is.</p>

<p>I assume a highly technical audience for this website, so the only other thing I&rsquo;ll say about technical considerations is &ldquo;Beware! You need to think more broadly.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="toc_1">Semantic considerations</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s very valuable to choose column types that describe the data, because the type serves as documentation about the data. Even if the data is documented in a written specification, if I choose the wrong data type, I&rsquo;ve contradicted the specification. The only true, authoritative specification of what a system does is the actual implementation, so it needs to be aligned with the reality of the system&rsquo;s purpose, not just its function.</p>

<p>At some point, meaning becomes very important, because there is often a wide latitude within which the technical considerations are immaterial. For example, if data type A, B, and C can all store the data adequately, some people may think &ldquo;well, at this point it doesn&rsquo;t matter; I can choose any of the three.&rdquo; Be careful with that assumption! When storing a price, for example, <code>MONEY</code> or a related type is a much better choice than other numeric types, even if they can store the same data. Conversely, one should never use a <code>MONEY</code> type to store something that&rsquo;s not a currency value.</p>

<p>There are also variations on data types that might confuse the issue. For example, in SQL Server 2000 the <code>DECIMAL</code> data type has the following storage requirements, depending on the precision (maximum total number of digits, both to the left and right of the decimal point):</p>

<table class="borders collapsed">
  <caption>Storage requirements in SQL Server 2000</caption> <tr>
    <th>
      Precision
    </th>
    
    <th>
      Storage bytes
    </th>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      1 &#8211; 9
    </td>
    
    <td>
      5
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      10-19
    </td>
    
    <td>
      9
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      20-28
    </td>
    
    <td>
      13
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      29-38
    </td>
    
    <td>
      17
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>I recently saw a table designed with a <code>DECIMAL(9, 1)</code> column to hold average customer ratings, whose values range from 0 to 5 with one decimal place. The best data type, in my opinion, is <code>DECIMAL(2, 1)</code>. Why did the developer add more precision?</p>

<p>According to the table above, the column requires 5 bytes of storage, whether the precision is 2 or 9. I can almost imagine the developer&rsquo;s train of thought:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This data is (2, 1) but that needs 5 bytes, and for the same size, I could get (9, 1). That&rsquo;s <em>free storage</em>! I should use it!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This imaginary line of reasoning is a fallacy. It values a factor that makes no difference, and ignores one that does.</p>

<h3 id="toc_2">Explaining the difference</h3>

<p>How do you explain this mindset to someone who&rsquo;s stuck in the &ldquo;free storage&rdquo; worldview? Let&rsquo;s look again at the two viewpoints:</p>

<ul>
<li>The developer&rsquo;s line of reasoning was &ldquo;I can get more capacity for the same storage, so I should.&rdquo;</li>
<li>A better train of thought is &ldquo;this data needs 5 bytes no matter what, so the unneeded extra storage is <em>valueless</em>, but the extra documentation provided by the smaller precision is <em>valuable</em>.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<p>In other words, one person thinks lack of control over data storage size makes the data storage capacity <em>very important</em>. The second person thinks the lack of control makes the data storage capacity <em>irrelevant</em>. I agree with the second person.</p>

<p>Notice the contrast between the technical and semantic factors. These two mindsets are in conflict. This is why I emphasized the need to temper the technical person&rsquo;s mindset, because technical people concentrate on their areas of competence. It&rsquo;s important to step back and take the technical blinders off, lest a sub-optimal choice look like the best thing.</p>

<p>How you approach it is up to you, but I might consider holding the unconscious decisions and gut feelings up in the light for conscious examination. I might also emphasize the value of the semantics. In the example I gave above, I simply emailed my thoughts to the <acronym title="Database administrator">DBA</acronym>s, who agreed immediately and changed the column type to <code>DECIMAL(2, 1)</code>. Perhaps it can be that simple, perhaps not.</p>

<h3 id="toc_3">Define your own types</h3>

<p>Many <acronym title="Relational database management system">RDBMS</acronym>s allow user-defined data types. At my current employer, I&rsquo;ve never seen this facility used. I would love to see us start doing so, though. It would be very helpful to define types such as <code>ITEMNO</code>, <code>CREDITCARDNO</code> and <code>TRACKINGCODE</code>. I think user-defined types are just as important as roles (another thing we don&rsquo;t use).</p>

<p>User-defined types do bring their own challenges; they require more work, may have technical ramifications (how the <acronym title="Relational database management system">RDBMS</acronym> handles the type across databases or servers where it may not be defined), might cause extra bureaucracy, and there are external factors to think about &ndash; educating a consultant who may need to work with the data, for example. Standard tools and code libraries may not be aware of them, too &ndash; for example, the .NET SqlClient classes. I think user-defined types are worth considering, but of course that&rsquo;s a decision that must be weighed carefully.</p>

<h3 id="toc_4">The moral of the story</h3>

<p>The moral of the story is &ldquo;think carefully.&rdquo; Now, if only I were better at that myself! The other moral, of course, is &ldquo;have fun.&rdquo;</p>
