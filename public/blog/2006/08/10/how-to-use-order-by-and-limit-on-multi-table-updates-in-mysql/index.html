<p>One of my colleagues recently redesigned a system for scheduling work, and needed to write a multiple-table <code>UPDATE</code> with <code>ORDER BY</code> and <code>LIMIT</code>, neither of which is supported for multiple-table UPDATE in MySQL. This article explains how to do it anyway, and shows how to rewrite a first attempt for hundreds of times better performance.</p>

<h3 id="toc_0">Introduction</h3>

<p>Without revealing too much about my employer&rsquo;s internal systems, I want to give a little bit of context. First, we have a table that holds work to be done:</p>

<pre>create table work_to_do (
   client int not null,
   work_unit int not null,
   priority float not null,
   processor int not null default 0,
   primary key(client, work_unit),
   key(priority),
   key(processor, priority)
) engine=InnoDB;</pre>

<p>Each row in this table represents a job for a client. The actual work is defined elsewhere, as rows in another table that can be looked up from <code>work_unit</code>. When there&rsquo;s some work to be done, the row is inserted with <code>processor</code> = 0 and <code>priority</code> set to some number calculated by another process. The idea is to do the highest-priority jobs first.</p>

<p>We have a program that may have multiple running instances, each of which looks at the table and tries to claim a set of work for itself, to be handled by no other process. In order to do this, each process tries to update some rows so <code>processor</code> is its UNIX process ID. Once <code>processor</code> is non-zero, the row is reserved for that process to do.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s another table that defines which clients are eligible for processing, whether they&rsquo;re in the <code>work_to_do</code> table or not.</p>

<h3 id="toc_1">The first attempt</h3>

<p>The query to claim a set of rows for a process needs to update the ten highest-priority unclaimed rows for eligible clients. Since it needs to access more than one table, and needs to order and limit the results, at first it seems you can&rsquo;t do this query at all, because <code>ORDER BY</code> and <code>LIMIT</code> aren&rsquo;t allowed for multi-table updates:</p>

<blockquote cite="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/update.html">
  <p>
    For the multiple-table syntax, UPDATE updates rows in each table named in table_references that satisfy the conditions. In this case, ORDER BY and LIMIT cannot be used.
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, a <a href="/blog/2006/03/11/many-to-one-problems-in-sql/">standard searched <code>UPDATE</code> statement</a> with a subquery doesn&rsquo;t count as a multi-table update, so you can do it like this:</p>

<pre>-- @process_id is actually passed in as a parameter
-- set @process_id = 17603;
update work_to_do
   set processor = @process_id
   where processor = 0
      and client in (select client from eligible_client)
   order by priority desc
   limit 10</pre>

<p>There&rsquo;s only one problem: performance sucks. You are probably aware that <code>IN()</code> subqueries are converted by the <code>in_optimizer</code> to correlated subqueries, <a href="/blog/2006/04/30/how-to-optimize-subqueries-and-joins-in-mysql/">sometimes with severe performance penalties</a>.</p>

<p>I created the tables on my home computer, and ran the above query with 5,000 rows in <code>work_to_do</code>. With 50 rows in <code>eligible_client</code> the query completes in a 0.13 seconds, but with 5,000 the correlated subquery becomes a real performance problem; it takes 9.8 seconds, which is very slow for this machine. It means this may be an O(n^2) algorithm.</p>

<h3 id="toc_2">The query after optimizing</h3>

<p>To eliminate the badly optimized subquery, you need to rewrite the subquery as a join, but how can you do that and retain the <code>LIMIT</code> and <code>ORDER BY</code>? One way is to find the rows to be updated in a subquery in the <code>FROM</code> clause, so the <code>LIMIT</code> and <code>ORDER BY</code> can be nested inside the subquery. In this way <code>work_to_do</code> is joined against the ten highest-priority unclaimed rows of itself. Normally <a href="/blog/2006/06/23/how-to-select-from-an-update-target-in-mysql/">you can&rsquo;t self-join the update target</a> in a multi-table <code>UPDATE</code>, but since it&rsquo;s within a subquery in the <code>FROM</code> clause, it works in this case.
<pre>update work_to_do as target
   inner join (
      select w. client, work_unit
      from work_to_do as w
         inner join eligible_client as e on e.client = w.client
      where processor = 0
      order by priority desc
      limit 10
   ) as source on source.client = target.client
      and source.work_unit = target.work_unit
   set processor = @process_id;</pre></p>

<p>Now the query runs in 0.04 seconds. That&rsquo;s a factor of 250 speedup, and it&rsquo;s even several times faster than the un-optimized query when there were only 50 rows in the <code>eligible_client</code> table.</p>

<p>There is one downside: the rows are not locked in primary key order. This may help explain the occasional deadlock we get on this table (see <a href="/blog/2006/08/03/a-little-known-way-to-cause-a-database-deadlock/">my article about a &ldquo;little-known&rdquo; way to cause a deadlock</a>). Do you have any suggestions for how to work around this?</p>

<h3 id="toc_3">Summary</h3>

<p>In this article I&rsquo;ve shown you how to use subqueries to work around limitations on multi-table <code>UPDATE</code> statements, and then I demonstrated how an alternate way to rewrite the query performs about 250 times better on a small data set than the obvious solution.</p>
