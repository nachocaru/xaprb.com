<p>In an earlier post I compared <a href="http://www.xaprb.com/blog/2005/12/30/excel-calc-number-formatting/">number formatting in Excel vs. OpenOffice.org Calc</a>. I&rsquo;ve learned some more interesting things about both spreadsheets, as regards opening CSV files and adding labels to XY scatter charts (spoiler: both spreadsheets have problems)</p>

<h3 id="toc_0">Opening CSV files with Excel</h3>

<p>Maybe someone else can answer this one for me, because I&rsquo;m stumped and can&rsquo;t seem to find the right search phrase to turn up relevant results in Google: I can&rsquo;t get Excel to open a .csv file on my friend&rsquo;s Mac. It runs OSX, and the &ldquo;About Excel&rdquo; dialog says &ldquo;Excel X for Mac&rdquo; (can you tell what a dummy I am when it comes to Mac? The only thing that saves me is the presence of the Terminal, so I can resort to the command line to do things). Both of us have tried all the ways we know. No matter what we do in the Open dialog, including choosing &ldquo;All Readable Files,&rdquo; it leaves CSV files grayed out. The only way we&rsquo;ve found is to rename it to something else such as .txt, open the file, and then do Data-&gt;Text To Columns.</p>

<h3 id="toc_1">Labelling XY scatter charts</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been working with cemetery data again. Recently we took a total station out to a cemetery and mapped it, then downloaded the data as tab-separated values. For a quick and dirty map of the data, it&rsquo;s great to import it into a spreadsheet, select the Northing and Easting columns, and map it as a scatter plot. This gives a quick sense of what the map looks like. Of course, when you&rsquo;ve got hundreds of points on the map, you want them labelled so you can see what they are, like so:</p>

<p><img src="/media/2006/01/oocalc-scatter-plot-result.png" alt="The desired result" width="365" height="193" /></p>

<p>The first column in the spreadsheet is the point&rsquo;s name. We tried and tried but couldn&rsquo;t get Excel to plot the points with nice labels next to them. A bit of Googling revealed lots of other frustrated folks with the same problem. This has been a limitation in Excel for many years, and so many people want this feature, I wonder why they aren&rsquo;t implementing it. The good news is, someone has written a little utility which will <a href="http://www.bmsltd.ie/MVP/MVPPage.asp">label XY scatter plots in Excel</a>, both for PC and Mac (<a href="http://www.appspro.com/Utilities/ChartLabeler.htm">here&rsquo;s another link</a>). So it&rsquo;s possible to do after all &ndash; just not easy, and not built-in.</p>

<p>On the other hand, opening the same file with <a href="http://www.openoffice.org">OpenOffice.org</a> Calc and creating the same graph led me to believe it is supported in Calc. The graphing autopilot has a step where I specified the first column as labels:</p>

<p><img src="/media/2006/01/oocalc-scatter-plot-step1.png" alt="Step 1, choosing the data" width="388" height="283" /></p>

<p>But after following through the rest of the steps &ndash; choose chart type, etc etc &ndash; the final result has no labels. I fooled around with it for a while, read the documentation and surfed the web, but still couldn&rsquo;t get it to show the labels. Only after <a href="http://www.oooforum.org/forum/viewtopic.phtml?t=30294">I posted on the OpenOffice.org forums</a> did I find an answer:</p>

<ol>
<li>Select the data, start the graphing AutoPilot, check &ldquo;First column as labels&rdquo; and create the graph</li>
<li>Place the cursor over the unselected graph and right click. Select &ldquo;Edit&rdquo;</li>
<li>Select &ldquo;Insert &gt; Data Labels&hellip;&rdquo; and check &ldquo;Show Label Text&rdquo;</li>
</ol>

<p>I probably would not have solved this on my own. The way to select and unselect charts, and how to modify their properties, is really unintuitive, I&rsquo;m afraid. Even after fooling with charts a while, I&rsquo;m still blundering through things like exactly what sequence of actions is necessary to make a chart editable, what I need to do to alter the scale on the axes, and so forth. Even if I had known all that in advance, though, I wouldn&rsquo;t think to go to the Insert menu to add labels to the chart. I told it to do that when I created the chart &ndash; why doesn&rsquo;t it show them by default? If I didn&rsquo;t want them to show, I wouldn&rsquo;t have specified the first column as labels.</p>

<p>I conclude both Excel and OpenOffice.org both have some room for improvement. I&rsquo;m sure that comes as no surprise! The good news is, OpenOffice.org is a community-driven effort, with an open bug-tracking system and active forums &ndash; not to mention it&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">Free Software</a>. You know who I&rsquo;m backing&hellip; take &lsquo;em to the mat!</p>
