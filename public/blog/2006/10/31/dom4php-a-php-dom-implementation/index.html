<p>Several years ago I wrote a pure PHP library for manipulating <a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/">XML</a> documents with the Document Object Model (<a href="http://www.w3.org/DOM/">DOM</a>) in <a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a> 4, without external libraries such as libxml. This is often useful on shared hosting providers, where you can&rsquo;t get C extensions installed. The library uses <a href="http://php.net/xml">PHP4&#8242;s built-in SAX </a>functions, which are enabled by default. Today I&rsquo;m re-releasing this library under the LGPL (EDIT: later re-released under MIT). You can find it <a href="https://github.com/xaprb/dom4php">here</a></p>

<h3 id="toc_0">Introduction</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s not too hard to build a DOM implementation on top of SAX. In fact, many DOM libraries actually use this technique. You just need to know the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Core/core.html">DOM core specification</a> really well, and understand SAX really well. Everything else is easy, haha. The truth is, I don&rsquo;t know how well I knew the spec back then, and I&rsquo;ve no time to check right now, so you&rsquo;ll have to let me know.</p>

<p>Since I wrote this years ago, before I was enamored of unit testing, I don&rsquo;t know how good it is. I&rsquo;ve used it for several years in production systems without ever looking at the actual code again &ndash; I just use it and take for granted that it works. I may or may not have time to actually write tests for it (probably not, sorry). Maybe you can help me with that. It shouldn&rsquo;t be hard, but I just don&rsquo;t have the time for it.</p>

<p>If you do want to hack the source, I encourage you to be ready to use a debugger. Getting references right is the tricky part. There are <em>lots</em> of references to be built and manipulated in a structure as complex as the DOM, and handling references correctly in PHP 4 is anything but easy for most people.</p>

<h3 id="toc_1">Documentation</h3>

<p>I never wrote much documentation for this library, but I might attempt to remedy that at some point (I probably don&rsquo;t have time though &ndash; sorry). In the meantime, here&rsquo;s a synopsis to get you started:</p>

<pre>&lt;?php

# Create a parser and parse a simple document.
include_once("XmlParser.php");
$parser   = new XmlParser($encoding = 'ISO-8859-1'); # encoding is optional
$document = $parser-&gt;parse('&lt;p class="test"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;this is a document&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;');

# Add a text node.
$text =& $document-&gt;createTextNode('foozle');
$document-&gt;childNodes[0]-&gt;appendChild($text);

# Navigate around the document a bit, starting at the new node we just added.
$strong =& $text-&gt;previousSibling;
echo "The content of the node is '" . $strong-&gt;childNodes[0]-&gt;data . "'\n";

# Serialize the XML document to a string.  Do NOT use print_r() as the cyclic
# data structures will cause problems.  Instead, create an instance of the
# XmlSerializer class.
include_once("XmlSerializer.php");
$serializer = new XmlSerializer("XML");
echo $serializer-&gt;serializeNode($document);
echo "\n";

?&gt;</pre>

<p>The real documentation is the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Core/core.html">DOM core specification</a>, as I said. The object you get back from calling <code>parse()</code> is a <code>Document</code>, and you just use the DOM as normal after that.</p>

<h3 id="toc_2">Differences from the DOM spec</h3>

<p>The DOM spec is pretty heavy-weight, and coding something like this in pure PHP isn&rsquo;t as efficient as using a C library. I made a couple of compromises for simplicity, performance, and convenience. The result should be a nearly complete DOM implementation, with much less code and overhead than it would take to follow the spec exactly. Here are the differences from the official specification:</p>

<ol>
<li>ID attributes (refer to the XML spec if you don&rsquo;t know what that means) are assumed to be named &ldquo;id&rdquo; and are kept in a lookup table with the document. This makes sure you can&rsquo;t duplicate an ID, and provides fast access to any element by ID. If you need to change the name from &ldquo;id&rdquo; to something else, you can do that.</li>
<li>Attributes aren&rsquo;t object-ified. Instead, attributes are stored as a lighter-weight associative array with each <code>Node</code>. You can set and retrieve attributes with object methods, but they aren&rsquo;t objects themselves.</li>
<li><code>Node</code> contains some convenience methods not found in the official spec. These are, for example, <code>getElementsByAttributeValue()</code>. Most of them are only used internally, but a few are meant for external use too.</li>
<li>Many of the interfaces in the official spec aren&rsquo;t really necessary for an 80% solution, including <code>DOMImplementation</code> and <code>NamedNodeMap</code>. I omit those.</li>
<li>No support for namespaces or namespace methods (e.g. <code>createAttributeNS</code>)</li>
</ol>

<p>There may be other differences too, but I can&rsquo;t think of them right now. Write into the comments if you see anything I missed. By the way, if you need some of the missing pieces such as <code>NamedNodeMap</code>, I can provide skeleton classes for you; I originally coded them, but then deleted them.</p>

<h3 id="toc_3">License</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m releasing this under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lgpl.html">GNU LGPL</a>. At one time I had licensed it under the normal GPL, but <a href="http://www.xaprb.com/blog/2006/06/19/xaprb-scripts-relicensed/">this isn&rsquo;t appropriate for a library</a>, so I&rsquo;m re-licensing it. EDIT: re-re-licensed under MIT. See <a href="https://github.com/xaprb/dom4php">https://github.com/xaprb/dom4php</a>.</p>

<h3 id="toc_4">Feedback welcome, and thanks for all the fish</h3>

<p>Please do leave feedback in the comments. Since I wrote this years ago and haven&rsquo;t really thought about it since then, I have no idea how good it is &ndash; I can only say I haven&rsquo;t run into any bugs in a while. Maybe I haven&rsquo;t implemented some things I should have, or maybe there are braindead things I&rsquo;ve done, who knows. Regardless, I hope you find it helpful.</p>

<p>See you next time!</p>
