<p>I have re-licensed some of my scripts under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lgpl.html">LGPL</a>, which means you can use them as part of other non-GPL software.</p>

<p>The scripts in question are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/blog/2006/01/05/javascript-number-formatting/">JavaScript number formatting</a></li>
<li><a href="/blog/2005/12/12/javascript-closures-for-runtime-efficiency/">JavaScript date/time formatting and parsing</a></li>
<li><a href="/blog/2005/09/29/javascript-date-chooser/">JavaScript date/time chooser</a> for HTML documents</li>
<li><a href="/blog/2005/09/29/javascript-combo-box/">JavaScript &ldquo;combo box&rdquo; simulation</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="toc_0">Why the change?</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always released my work under the GPL, but now that I&rsquo;m writing and making available smaller scripts that might be used as part of a larger software system, the GPL isn&rsquo;t as appropriate, because of the licensing requirements it places on the rest of the systems with which the scripts may be used.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not making the decision casually. I&rsquo;m a firm believer in <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/philosophy.html">free software</a>, as in software freedom. Not only should software be open and un-encumbered by restrictions, but this freedom should be guaranteed even to the extent of prohibiting someone from making a restricted non-free work based on it. Software is encoded knowledge that belongs to humanity as a whole, just as certainly as mathematical formulae. That&rsquo;s why I oppose non-free software and software patents.</p>

<p>However, for certain small scripts I&rsquo;ve written, this rigid approach doesn&rsquo;t make sense. I&rsquo;m not releasing these scripts as &ldquo;software.&rdquo; The scripts mainly serve as working examples of principles and methods I&rsquo;m trying to illustrate. From that point of view, the knowledge encoded in the scripts is already free &ndash; it&rsquo;s in the articles I write to introduce the scripts, techniques and algorithms. Plus, I&rsquo;m not breaking any new ground with the articles, either. Nothing I say here is revolutionary.</p>

<p>I read Richard Stallman&rsquo;s writing carefully. Though he has a reputation for being a hard-liner, I value his opinions and judgement highly. When I&rsquo;ve had contact with him, he&rsquo;s come across just as he does in his essays: as a man of principles, which he will not yield. I respect that. One of his essays is about <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html"><em>not</em> using the LGPL</a>. For the reasons stated above, I don&rsquo;t think the points raised in that essay are applicable to the scripts I&rsquo;ve released on this website. I believe these scripts are best released under a more permissive license.</p>

<h3 id="toc_1">The future</h3>

<p>This is also a forward-looking change. I&rsquo;m not trying to be grandiose about these little scripts I&rsquo;ve written. They&rsquo;re small snippets and they won&rsquo;t change the world. But I&rsquo;ve been working on some other things that are more significant, and I want everything I release to be licensed consistently with my beliefs. When I release these other projects, I&rsquo;ll be careful to license them in accordance with what they are, what they do, and how others might find them useful.</p>

<p>I hope you, or the projects you&rsquo;re working on, will find my work useful. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions, comments, or improvements.</p>
