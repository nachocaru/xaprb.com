<p>SQL blind inserts are a common mistake, but they&rsquo;re easily avoided. This article explains what blind inserts are and how to avoid them, as well as dispelling a common misconception about how to avoid them.</p>

<h3 id="toc_0">What is a blind insert?</h3>

<p>A blind insert is when an <code>INSERT</code> query doesn&rsquo;t specify which columns receive the inserted data. For instance, this query is a blind insert:</p>

<pre>insert into apples
   select color, price, variety
   from fruits
   where type = 'apple';</pre>

<p>Notice the query doesn&rsquo;t say what columns are targeted by the <code>INSERT</code>. In fact, it&rsquo;s impossible to tell just by looking at this query. The only thing I know from this query is that the first three columns of the <code>apples</code> table, whatever those may be, will receive the values from the <code>SELECT</code>.</p>

<p>This query needs to specify the target columns by name, all of them:</p>

<pre>insert into apples (color, price, type)
   select color, price, variety
   from fruits
   where type = 'apple';</pre>

<h3 id="toc_1">Why is this a bad thing?</h3>

<p>Because the database schema may change. Columns may be moved, renamed, added, or deleted. And when they are, one of at least three things can happen:</p>

<ol>
<li>The query fails. This is the best-case scenario. Someone deleted a column from the target table, and now there aren&rsquo;t enough columns for the insert to go into, or someone changed a data type and the inserted type isn&rsquo;t compatible, or so on. But at least your data isn&rsquo;t getting corrupted, and you may even know the problem exists because of an error message.</li>
<li>The query continues to work, and nothing is wrong. This is a middle-worst-case scenario. Your data isn&rsquo;t corrupt, but the monster is still hiding under the bed.</li>
<li>The query continues to work, but now some data is being inserted somewhere it doesn&rsquo;t belong. Your data is getting corrupted.</li>
</ol>

<p>Usually, when this happens, it&rsquo;s in the middle of the night when that scheduled task runs, and you&rsquo;re at home in bed when the phone rings. Yuck!</p>

<p>Even in the best case, it can be hard to figure out what&rsquo;s wrong, because the columns in the target table aren&rsquo;t the way they used to be. You could end up very confused, under a lot of pressure to fix something in the middle of the night, and the extra documentation provided by the named target columns isn&rsquo;t there. Notice in my example above, the <code>variety</code> column from the <code>fruits</code> table is actually supposed to go into the <code>type</code> column in the <code>apples</code> table. Imagine there&rsquo;s also a column named <code>variety</code> on the <code>apples</code> table, but it&rsquo;s for a different bit of data&hellip; you might end up trying to &lsquo;fix&rsquo; the broken query by putting the wrong data into the wrong column, if you didn&rsquo;t have those named targets to alert you that&rsquo;s not the right thing to do.</p>

<h3 id="toc_2">How to fix this</h3>

<p>The solution is really easy, of course. Just name the inserts. But it goes beyond that; it helps to have a <a href="/blog/2006/04/26/sql-coding-standards/">coding standard</a> and a review process when code is released.</p>

<p>Sometimes I&rsquo;ve seen people get confused about the distinction between naming the target columns and naming the select columns. For example, sometimes people think this is equivalent to naming the target columns:</p>

<pre>insert into apples
   select 5 as price, ...</pre>

<p>The above syntax does <em>not</em> put 5 into the <code>price</code> column. The source columns can be named anything; it&rsquo;s just a name, and it doesn&rsquo;t influence where the data goes. In fact, giving anonymous columns in the source a name is completely superfluous. Even if you&rsquo;re in the habit of doing it as &ldquo;documentation&rdquo; of where the source should go, it&rsquo;s a bad idea, simply because it can become wrong when someone changes the query. It&rsquo;s like <a href="/blog/2005/12/10/tell-me-why-not-what/">a comment that repeats what the code already says</a>: it&rsquo;s redundant, and therefore a liability.</p>
