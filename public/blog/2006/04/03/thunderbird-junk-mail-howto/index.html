<p>Mozilla Thunderbird has an excellent spam filter built into it, but if you don&rsquo;t understand how it works, it may just frustrate you. In this article I&rsquo;ll show you how to use it to its full advantage.</p>

<h3 id="toc_0">Overview</h3>

<p>There are several different ways to distinguish good mail from junk mail. One of the most popular is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_filtering">Bayesian filter</a>, which is sometimes combined with other techniques as well. <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/thunderbird/">Mozilla Thunderbird</a> has a built-in Bayesian filter. It can learn the difference between good and junk mail, and then Thunderbird can handle the junk mail as desired.</p>

<p>To get the most out of junk mail filtering, you need to turn filtering on, train your filter, and configure Thunderbird to handle junk mail as you wish.</p>

<h3 id="toc_1">Turn filtering on</h3>

<p>There are several steps to enabling filtering. Here&rsquo;s how I do it. First, I open the Tools/Junk Mail Controls dialog. I select my email account in the pull-down menu, then check the following options:</p>

<ul>
<li>WhiteLists &ndash; I check the &ldquo;Do not mark&hellip;&rdquo; option</li>
<li>Handling &ndash; I check the &ldquo;Move the&hellip;&rdquo; option, and select a folder to move the messages to. I don&rsquo;t want to delete the junk mail yet. I need it to train the filter. I check the &ldquo;When I manually&hellip;&rdquo; option, and again select to move them. Thunderbird is a bit weird about handling messages when I mark them as junk; it&rsquo;s like having the rug pulled out from under me, so sometimes I mark the wrong one by accident.</li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t use logging, because I don&rsquo;t have Thunderbird delete messages for me automatically.</li>
</ul>

<p>I switch to the &ldquo;Adaptive Filter&rdquo; tab and check the &ldquo;Enable adaptive junk mail detection&rdquo; option. This is the real magic. It turns on the Bayesian filter and starts it learning.</p>

<h3 id="toc_2">Train the filter</h3>

<p>Bayesian filters are &ldquo;learning&rdquo; filters; they need to be taught to recognize <strong>both good and junk mail</strong>. They learn not only the probability of an email being junk, but the probability it is good, and use both to determine whether to mark an email as junk.</p>

<p>Once I turn the filters on, I run them. By default Thunderbird examines new messages as they come into my inbox, but I have folder after folder of saved messages I know to be good, which is a great way to train the filter. I simply go to each folder and run the filter with the &ldquo;Tools/Run Junk Mail Controls&hellip;&rdquo; menu option, then correct each message it thinks is junk. By doing so, I&rsquo;m telling it how to recognize good messages.</p>

<p>When my Junk folder has a few messages in it, I look through them and correct the filter if it got any wrong. When I see junk mail in my Inbox that isn&rsquo;t detected as junk, I mark it as junk and teach the filter the error of its ways.</p>

<h3 id="toc_3">Sit back and enjoy</h3>

<p>This sounds tedious, but in reality it only takes a few tries for the filter to get good, very good indeed. After a day or two, the filter worked so well for me that I&rsquo;ve very rarely had to correct it since. It identifies thousands of junk messages almost without fail. Occasionally I open my Junk folder and sort it by sender. This makes it easy to see if there are any messages I want to keep. I can&rsquo;t remember the last time there were any. Then I select &ldquo;Tools/Delete Mail Marked as Junk in Folder&rdquo; and delete all the junk.</p>

<p>If junk mail plagues you, and you don&rsquo;t want to rely on some program that might delete something important, you might give Thunderbird a try. You might find it works better than you imagined.</p>
