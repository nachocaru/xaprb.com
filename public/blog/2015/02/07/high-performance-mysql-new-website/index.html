</p>

<p>I recently updated the <a href="http://www.highperfmysql.com">High Performance MySQL</a>
website to modernize it. I am impressed at how easy it is these days to get a
great little brochure site hosted, and wanted to write about it. It used to be a
lot more work. I used a variety of tools and services to do this and hope it&rsquo;s
of interest.</p>

<h3 id="toc_0">Before</h3>

<p>The website used to be a WordPress blog. This used to be my go-to solution for
everything. It used to be the easiest way to whip together something quickly and
put it online.</p>

<p>But WordPress sites have a bunch of problems.</p>

<ul>
<li>They need a database. Database down, website down.</li>
<li>They need care and feeding. WordPress is a major hack target and you have to
update it or you&rsquo;re going to end up serving malware and ads without knowing
it. You also have to update the plugins and themes. It&rsquo;s just a lot of hassle.</li>
<li>They&rsquo;re not high performance, primarily because of the dynamic content.</li>
</ul>

<p>I just can&rsquo;t make time to babysit sites like this anymore.
As a result I&rsquo;ve been moving everything to good old static sites again.
Static sites used to be a lot of work too. Not anymore.</p>

<h3 id="toc_1">Static Site Generators</h3>

<p>Static site generators like <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> are a whole new world
of writing ease. Write Markdown, run the generator, get a static site fully
rendered. It&rsquo;s great. Jekyll, though, still has some annoyances. It requires a
lot of dependencies (my nemesis is <code>bundle install</code>&hellip; I hate how often that
breaks and takes a long time to work around for whatever version of Ruby gems
and dependencies and compilers and stuff are involved) and Jekyll itself isn&rsquo;t
really a site, it&rsquo;s just the scaffolding for a site.</p>

<p>I use <a href="http://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> for this site because of the amount and
complexity of content on it. Hugo is nicer than Jekyll in my opinion, much
better actually. But for a site like High Performance MySQL, a one-page brochure
is really what&rsquo;s needed. For that, a simple static <code>index.html</code> is better. No
need for a site generator.</p>

<h3 id="toc_2">Bootstrap and Bootstrap Themes</h3>

<p>Probably the biggest part of making a site these days is creating a good design
that will look good on everything from a desktop browser to an old iPhone.
<a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Twitter Bootstrap</a> provides a foundation for doing a
lot of that. It&rsquo;s an amazing advancement over the bad old days.</p>

<p>Combine that with thousands of freely available designs/themes based on
Bootstrap, and you have lots of great options for a brochure site. For this
site, I chose the
<a href="http://www.blacktie.co/2013/10/pratt-app-landing-page/">Pratt</a> theme from
<a href="http://www.blacktie.co/about/">BlackTie</a>. Thanks, Carlos! If you need a custom
theme, Carlos does freelance work too.</p>

<h3 id="toc_3">Hosting On GitHub Pages</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;d say &ldquo;GitHub Pages is the best-kept secret&rdquo;, but it&rsquo;s not really a secret
anymore among the people likely to be reading this blog. If you&rsquo;re not familiar
with GitHub Pages, you should really look into it. It&rsquo;s easily the best way to
host small sites these days. Anything that doesn&rsquo;t need to be highly dynamic,
and doesn&rsquo;t need HTTPS access, is a great fit. Even things like blogs that need
commenting functionality can work great this way. What you get is free, <em>fast</em>
hosting with a built-in CDN, and everything&rsquo;s taken care of for you. You can use
Gist to host your source code examples and snippets nicely. And
maintaining and publishing the site just couldn&rsquo;t be much easier, since GitHub
hosts the source code, issues, and so on for free as well. <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Learn more about
GitHub pages</a>.</p>

<h3 id="toc_4">A Spash of Panache</h3>

<p>The cover image you saw at the top of this post adds a dash of visual flair. If
you produce any content and want it to be more attractive and desirable, such as
ebooks or tutorials, an eye-catching cover image makes all the difference. If
you have a flat image of the cover, though, how do you turn it into something
more visually appealing? How do you do this?</p>

<p><img src="/media/2015/02/hpm-rendering.png" alt="HPM Rendered" />
</p>

<p>I have access to Photoshop, and I found a great set of ready-made Photoshop
actions to do this. The site is called <a href="http://www.psdcovers.com/">PSD Covers</a>
and it contains an action that&rsquo;s ready to use for practically any kind of cover
you can dream up. One caveat, it didn&rsquo;t initially work well for me due to a bug
in Photoshop CC 2014, but the
<a href="http://www.psdcovers.com/photoshop-cc-2014-1-0-canvas-dpi-bug/">workaround</a> is
easy. I used the <a href="http://www.psdcovers.com/softcover019/">Softcover Handbook</a>
action. Thanks very much to Simon Lord for sharing this great set of resources
freely.</p>

<h3 id="toc_5">Making The Image Smaller</h3>

<p>Whenever I use an image like the above of the book cover, I tend to run it
through <a href="http://tinypng.com/">TinyPNG</a>. I often reduce images to just 10% or 20%
of their original size with this great resource. This makes it a lot more
feasible to include high-resolution versions of such images so they&rsquo;ll look
really sharp on devices with very high-resolution screens, like a newer iPad, a
Retina or better Apple device, or even my own favorite Android tablet, the <a href="http://www.xaprb.com/blog/2015/01/19/install-cyanogenmod-nook-hdplus/">B&amp;N
Nook
HD+</a>.
If you have a JPEG image, there&rsquo;s a <a href="https://tinyjpg.com/">TinyJPEG</a> site too.
The resulting hi-res images look great and download fast.</p>

<h3 id="toc_6">Writing The Content</h3>

<p>This is the easy and fun part for me, because I like to write. In this case, I
mostly just copy-pasted the content off the old Wordpress site, and then
massaged it a bit. I did discard all of the old blog posts that used to exist on
that site, but I don&rsquo;t think anyone cares. It never should have been a &ldquo;blog&rdquo; to
begin with; a single-page brochureware site is all that&rsquo;s necessary.</p>
