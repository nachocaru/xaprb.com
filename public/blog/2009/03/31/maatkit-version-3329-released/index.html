  <p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/maatkit/">Maatkit</a> version 3329 has been released, as per our usual monthly release cycle.</p>

<p>Significant changes in this version include some bug fixes to mk-duplicate-key-checker, and a lot of new features in mk-query-digest. We made some changes to mk-table-checksum and mk-table-sync. We also updated shared code in all tools.</p>

<p>Interesting and significant things to mention this month:</p>

<ul>
<li>Thanks to a corporation who sponsored development on certain tools (I haven&rsquo;t gotten permission to mention their name.)</li>
<li>The efforts to be more inclusive and participatory (e.g. more truly open-source) have really paid off, and personally I find it very gratifying to see the discussions on the mailing list. And new project members have contributed code and very useful advice! Thanks, and hooray!</li>
<li>The project wiki is reorganized and much better to use now.</li>
</ul>
