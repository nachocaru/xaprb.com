      <p>Last weekend, my brother and I attended <a href="http://www.southeastlinuxfest.org/">SELF 2009</a>. A few thoughts on it:</p>

<p>The mixture of sessions was interesting. There were some really good ones. I think the best session I attended was an OpenSolaris/NetBeans/Glassfish/Virtualbox/ZFS session, given by a Sun employee. He was an excellent presenter, and really showed off the strengths of the technologies in a nice way. He started up enough VMs to make his OpenSolaris laptop chew into swap, and I thought it was fun to see how it dealt with that. I&rsquo;ve heard Solaris and OpenSolaris do a lot better at avoiding and managing swapping than GNU/Linux, but I couldn&rsquo;t make any opinion from watching. I did think it was odd to have this session at a &ldquo;Linux&rdquo; (yes, they left off the GNU) conference. But I thought the session was a good addition to the conference. In other sessions, and in the hallways and expo, there was a lot more slant towards open-source software and gadgetry in general than there was towards GNU/Linux. The sessions that were about Linux or GNU/Linux were top-heavy towards topics like educational initiatives.</p>

<p>The Free Software Foundation had a booth in the expo hall. It was funny that they didn&rsquo;t boycott the event, because I know RMS won&rsquo;t speak at so-called &ldquo;Linux User Groups&rdquo; and insists they be called &ldquo;GNU/Linux User Groups.&rdquo; I guess the FSF is not unified behind that banner. Regardless, I used the opportunity to renew my membership perpetually. I&rsquo;m so lazy that I need something like this to stay involved!</p>

<p>The expo hall was dominated by Red Hat, Fedora, and SUSE; PostgreSQL was there, but not MySQL. There was a good variety and number of vendors. It was great to see the healthy support of the event, which was free, by the way.</p>

<p>Clemson, SC is not easy to get to, and while the Clemson campus was attractive and functioned fine, it&rsquo;s nothing you can&rsquo;t find elsewhere. I ended up driving over 9 hours to get to it. I&rsquo;d have preferred the technology triangle, which if nothing else is close to major airports, bus and train stops, and Red Hat.</p>

<p>Richard Hipp talked about the great fsync() bug, a similar talk to the one he gave at the first OpenSQL Camp. Someone asked about Tokyo Cabinet and he responded that he hasn&rsquo;t found any fsync() calls in its source code. *cough* Something worth thinking about for on-disk usage (I haven&rsquo;t looked at its source much myself). TC can also be used in-memory-only, and a while back I suggested that usage of it for Drizzle to replace the Memory engine; I don&rsquo;t know what became of that.</p>
