<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/MySQL-Administrators-Bible-Wiley/dp/0470416912?tag=xaprb-20">MySQL Administrator&rsquo;s Bible</a> by Sheeri K. Cabral and Keith Murphy, 2009. Page count: 800+ pages. (Here&rsquo;s a <a href="http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470416912.html">link to the publisher&rsquo;s site</a>.)</p>

<p>This book is a comprehensive reference guide to MySQL that&rsquo;s accessible to beginning DBAs or DBAs familiar with another database. It has enough detail to be a useful companion throughout a DBA&rsquo;s career. It also covers many related technologies, such as memcached, at a moderate-but-useful level of detail. This isn&rsquo;t exactly a how-to book, and it isn&rsquo;t exactly a reference manual; it&rsquo;s more of a blend of the two.</p>

<p>The audience will depend on personal preferences. Some of the reference material is the type of thing I would look up with command-line <code>--help</code> options or the MySQL manual. But there are times when the reference aspect of the book is uniquely valuable. For example, the online documentation tends to list things alphabetically; the book might break them down into groups by function. An example is the <code>sql_mode</code> parameters, which it groups into categories like &ldquo;Getting rid of silent failures, silent conversions, and silently allowing invalid data.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The non-reference aspect of the book has a lot of examples of how to do things, such as how to set up replication over SSL. This is exactly what I&rsquo;d look for in a book. Otherwise, you&rsquo;re reduced to reading documentation (inefficient, mind-numbing) or trusting the information you find online, which is generally not something I do.</p>

<p>Speaking of trusting information, I was happy to see very few typos or errors. Occasionally I caught a minor slip. For example, when discussing the limited memory a 32-bit mysqld can use because it runs in a single process, there&rsquo;s a typo that mis-states this architectural feature as &ldquo;mysqld is currently single-threaded,&rdquo; which is not quite the same thing. Overall, you can rely on the information you&rsquo;ll read in this book.</p>

<p>The book is divided into four parts: first steps, developing with MySQL, core administration, and a set of chapters and appendixes grouped under extending your skills. I think this organization works well. You can read the full Table Of Contents at the publisher&rsquo;s site linked above.</p>

<p>Coverage is for MySQL 5.1 and 6.0. As we know, 5.1 was GA&rsquo;ed and 6.0 has been killed and replaced by a new release policy. This gives a slightly odd feeling to some passages, which speak about 5.1 in the past tense and 6.0 in the present tense! As far as I know, however, this book contains the most complete coverage of MySQL 5.1 in print. The only other similar book I&rsquo;ve read that covers 5.1 is <em><a href="http://tinyurl.com/highperfmysql">High Performance MySQL 2nd Edition</a></em> &ndash; and that one is a bit light on details because there wasn&rsquo;t a lot of production knowledge of 5.1 yet (I&rsquo;m the lead author of <em>HPM2e</em>, by the way).</p>

<p>Speaking of which, I think that <em>MySQL Administrator&rsquo;s Bible</em> is a very good complement to <em>High Performance MySQL, 2nd Edition</em>. The former is useful to people who have varying levels of knowledge, while the latter assumes a lot of experience and doesn&rsquo;t cover introductory material much. And the books have different topics, of course. So if you&rsquo;re new to databases, or if you&rsquo;re new to MySQL, you might do well to start with Sheeri&rsquo;s book, then continue or supplement your education with ours.</p>

<p>All in all, this is a book that&rsquo;s well worth buying if you&rsquo;re going to administer a serious MySQL installation. I tip my hat to Sheeri &ndash; I don&rsquo;t know how she did it. It&rsquo;s a huge project and she pulled through the last (and by far most difficult) part of it by herself.</p>

<p><em>Disclosure: I tried to be a tech reviewer for this book, but I was over-committed and had to back out after a while.</em></p>
