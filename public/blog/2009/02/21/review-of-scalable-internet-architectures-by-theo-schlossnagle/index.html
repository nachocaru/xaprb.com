      <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/067232699X?tag=xaprb-20"><img src="http://www.xaprb.com/media/2009/02/scalable_internet_architectures.jpg" alt="Scalable Internet Architectures" title="scalable_internet_architectures" width="240" height="240" /></a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve just finished reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/067232699X?tag=xaprb-20">Scalable Internet Architectures</a> by <a href="http://omniti.com/is/theo-schlossnagle">Theo Schlossnagle</a>. It&rsquo;s a great book. Anyone building large systems should read it. Heck, anyone building any system that needs to run on more than one server should read it.</p>

<p>The book got mixed reviews on Amazon, but I really think that&rsquo;s about writing style, not substance. Sometimes Theo takes the reader on a scenic tour of something that doesn&rsquo;t seem to have much to do with the subject matter, and then wraps up by showing how it is actually directly relevant. For example, he spends quite a bit of time talking about why HTTPS inherently poses different scaling problems than HTTP. If you aren&rsquo;t a patient reader, you might bail out before getting to the punch line.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a pretty compact book, at 225 pages (plus an appendix on <a href="http://www.spread.org/">Spread</a>). Theo&rsquo;s writing is terse, even blunt at times. He knows what he&rsquo;s talking about and he expects you to do your part to keep up with him. You need to start at the beginning and read the whole book. This isn&rsquo;t a reference that you can just pick up to get five-minute answers.</p>

<p>The topics are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Scaling Up (and Down)</li>
<li>Principles for Avoiding Failure</li>
<li>Mission-Critical Environments</li>
<li>High Availability. <em>HA! No Downtime?!</em></li>
<li>Load Balancing <em>and the Utter Confusion Surrounding It</em></li>
<li>Static Content Serving <em>for Speed and Glory</em></li>
<li>Static Meets Dynamic <em>Adding Caches to Reduce Costs</em></li>
<li>Distributed Databases Are Easy <em>Just Read the Fine Print</em></li>
<li>Juggling Logs <em>and Other Circus Tricks</em></li>
<li>The Right Tool for the Job</li>
</ul>

<p>These subjects may not seem to add up to a holistic worldview of scalability, but trust me, it works out that way. Theo uses specific scenarios &ndash; in complete detail &ndash; to illustrate larger concepts. You have to work to follow him, but the payoff is big. Here&rsquo;s a sample of the conclusion to one excursion into the woods:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Where are we going with this? &hellip; Each request we passed through the server during our contrived test required 743ms of attention. Of that time, 87ms was <em>not</em> horizontally scalable&hellip; we were simply attempting to show that some portion of the interaction was dependent on shared, nonscalable resources. We succeeded; now how do we fix it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Have you ever wondered how to build an architecture that automatically results in website visitors accessing the data center nearest them <em>in network distance</em>? No, the answer isn&rsquo;t looking up IP addresses to determine geographic location. There&rsquo;s actually an elegant solution to this problem, and I didn&rsquo;t know it.</p>

<p>What about this one: what&rsquo;s a scalable way to invalidate a cache that lives on the filesystem of many machines at once? What if one of the machines doesn&rsquo;t obey is offline or misses the message for some reason?</p>

<p>This book is about how to think scalably. Just as an SQL programmer must learn to think relationally, a person who hopes to design a scalable application architecture must learn to think the right way. And Theo teaches this paradigm better than I&rsquo;ve seen it done before.</p>
