  <h1>Gratitude for a consistent focus on value</h1>

      <p>I&rsquo;ve been going through some old stuff that got thrown into a big cardboard box during my move in September. In particular there are a lot of papers from my desk &ndash; old notes I&rsquo;d scratched down, legal pads full of notes taken during phone conversations, and so on.</p>

<p>Reading through these old conversations brings them back to me. There are notes from my first &ldquo;non-interview&rdquo; with <a href="http://www.rkgblog.com/">Alan Rimm-Kaufman of The Rimm-Kaufman Group</a>. (That non-interview led to me leave my previous job and join his company.) And lots and lots of notes on conversations I&rsquo;ve had with others at the Rimm-Kaufman Group. And there&rsquo;s a napkin with scribblings from when <a href="http://www.percona.com/">Peter and Vadim</a> and I were riding in a car last April &ndash; the first time we&rsquo;d gotten to talk alone together since I joined Percona, although I&rsquo;d gotten to know them somewhat during an <a href="http://www.highperfmysql.com/">intense writing project</a> that spanned a year.</p>

<p>One of the things that&rsquo;s really neat about reading through notes from the past 3.5 years is seeing what changes over that time. For example, I&rsquo;m seeing things I was working on that I&rsquo;m not even involved in anymore. But even more striking is what doesn&rsquo;t change at all.</p>

<p>To put it briefly, their focus on values is completely consistent over time &ndash; I see refinements, but the deepest core is constant. Their values come from who they fundamentally are, and they don&rsquo;t change. Reading these notes from our conversations is just like reading notes I might have written a few days ago. This is a real source of inspiration and gratitude to me.</p>

<p>Here are some samples, slightly paraphrased because I&rsquo;m expanding my shorthand back into real sentences:</p>

<ul>
<li>I believe that people are best at what they enjoy doing. Employees having fun and making money provide a unique value to customers.</li>
<li>The best way to deliver value is to match your pay to the benefits of what you deliver, so there is only one motive and it&rsquo;s aligned to the customer&rsquo;s interests.</li>
<li>Your career should be what you love.</li>
<li>Open communications. There should never be a punishment for speaking what you feel.</li>
<li>Non-experts have a lot to teach us.</li>
<li>You should have a stake in the outcome.</li>
</ul>

<p>I won&rsquo;t say which quote came from whom. It doesn&rsquo;t matter &ndash; any of them could have said these things. And a lot of people say such things, but the fruits of their labors bear witness to their true belief in these principles. This just supports me in my own convictions. I hope I provide good support in return.</p>

<p>From these conversations I have turned down many paths I might not have otherwise taken: reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Let-People-Surfing-Education-Businessman/dp/1594200726">Let My People Go Surfing</a> and countless other books, for example. One of the things I love about this cycle of reinforcement is seeing the businesses follow this leadership, both internally and externally. And when I feel like I&rsquo;m not aligned with my own values, I can have a conversation with one of the people whom I know share my values, and they help me find where the disconnect is and get back on track again.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an example: a <a href="http://peterzaitsev.com/2009/01/09/are-all-rates-created-equal/">a recent post on pricing</a> from Peter, and <a href="http://www.rimmkaufman.com/rkgblog/2008/02/15/ppc-sem-pricing-models/">one from Alan from a while ago</a>. They both understand that the pricing model drives the behavior towards the customer, and they&rsquo;ve both aligned with the customer&rsquo;s benefit. It&rsquo;s completely consistent because it&rsquo;s truly who they are.</p>

<p>One of the other neat things about working with such people is their intense practicality. I am sometimes motivated so much towards what I feel is right, that I need their help to see a clear answer to the question &ldquo;how much does this matter? What&rsquo;s a good balance?&rdquo; They help me to stay more centered.</p>

<p>These people have been and continue to be sources of inspiration and strength for me. Thanks!</p>
