      <p>I was at <a href="http://opensqlcamp.org/Events/Portland2009/">OpenSQL Camp 2009 in Portland</a> last weekend. I thought the event was very well done. On Friday we had a pizza party at Old Town Pizza, which was awesome. Saturday and Sunday were breakfast, sessions, lunch (yum), and sessions and hacking. These were held at <a href="http://www.soukllc.com/">souk</a>, a co-working space. After 5PM, people got together for dinner, beer, etc.</p>

<p>I presented on mk-query-digest &ndash; a live demo of features requested by the audience. Sessions from others that I thought were particularly good included ones on CouchDB and MongoDB. I mixed up the time and missed the session from Tokutek on how fractal tree indexes work. I&rsquo;ll try to watch the video if that one was taped.</p>

<p>During the hackathons, Daniel and I worked on Maatkit. We are laying groundwork for a more powerful mk-query-digest.</p>

<p>As you may know, I created OpenSQL Camp. But I was not involved in organizing this or the previous event in Germany, which I think is great. I talked briefly with Eric and Selena about seeing if we could put together a recipe to make the process easy for folks to organize their own. We should be able to lay out checklists and timelines of major things &ndash; location, shirts, sponsorship, budgeting, food. Eric and Selena got great food, much better than the Panera catering I had for the first event. Those kinds of decisions and results should be recorded. It would be great to be able to treat it like a franchise so anyone could just add water and make their own.</p>

<p>I also might be willing to help organize another on the East Coast, perhaps as soon as next year if I can reduce my workload enough to have the time. I&rsquo;d probably want to do something in or near Washington DC, which is a more convenient location with better public transport than my hometown of Charlottesville.</p>

<p>It all started out as a response to <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/oursql-conference">complaints</a> about MySQL&rsquo;s annual conference not being a user&rsquo;s conference, but nobody actually doing anything about it. I decided to do something about it, in a more inclusive way. And judging by the attendees and talks at the two I&rsquo;ve gone to, people were happy to say yes to that. I think if there are continued events, that&rsquo;s the ultimate measure of success.</p>
