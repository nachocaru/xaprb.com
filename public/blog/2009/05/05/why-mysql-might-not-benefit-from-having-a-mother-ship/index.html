  <p>As I was driving with a colleague in California a couple of weeks ago during the conference, the topic of conversation turned to the notion that Percona and the rest of the MySQL community really need the presence of a central entity that provides a recognized home for the MySQL server. The conversation went something like &ldquo;I was talking to so-and-so, and he said, <em>you know, you guys really need Sun/MySQL, because without the mother ship, things will fall apart and your own business will fail</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I happen to believe this is FUD, and that the reverse might actually be true. (This is one reason why we&rsquo;re <a href="http://www.xaprb.com/blog/2009/04/20/a-review-of-how-life-imitates-chess/">competing</a> head-on with MySQL.) Having a &ldquo;mother ship&rdquo; is in the long run, a very complex scenario to fully understand. There are all sorts of causes and effects that play out in subtle ways. I honestly doubt anyone can really know what the true effect is.</p>

<p>So what <em>can</em> we say about the presence or absence of a single controlling organization, then? Simply this: we can look for examples of where power is decentralized, and see how it fares. Let&rsquo;s see some names:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Linux kernel.</li>
<li>The GNU/Linux operating system in all its variations.</li>
<li>PostgreSQL.</li>
<li>Apache.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are more that I could mention. But these are good enough examples to show that a thriving ecosystem is possible when power is not completely concentrated. In many ways, these projects have been far more successful than MySQL. I invite you to simply take a look at the Postgres hackers mailing list to see the PostgreSQL project&rsquo;s success first-hand.</p>

<p>I can mention a few effects I&rsquo;ve seen in the MySQL world that I don&rsquo;t see elsewhere, and which I attribute to the presence of MySQL the corporation. The single biggest one I see is how the community around MySQL differs from, say, the community around PostgreSQL. As I said in my recent keynote address at the <a href="http://conferences.percona.com/">Percona Performance Conference</a>, I think the best way to describe it is &ldquo;MySQL <em>has</em> a community. PostgreSQL <em>is</em> a community.&rdquo; (That&rsquo;s a quote from a PostgreSQL community member.)</p>

<p>PostgreSQL isn&rsquo;t the only project I can point to &ndash; Drizzle, for example, is taking a very good approach in my opinion. But any of these will do as an example. The key point is that there is a fundamentally different outlook on the relationship, both inside and outside MySQL, than there might be. On the outside, I have observed a lot of passivity and negativity. On the inside, I sometimes detect something that might be called paternalism.</p>

<p>Unflattering &ndash; yes, I&rsquo;m being rather unflattering. But let&rsquo;s be honest. The status quo between MySQL and &ldquo;the community&rdquo; is not good, not good at all. It resembles nothing so much as the relationship between users and producers of a proprietary product. That&rsquo;s not bad for a proprietary product &ndash; but really bad for an open-source one. Just the fact that we talk about MySQL and &ldquo;the community&rdquo; as though they&rsquo;re separate reveals a lot.</p>

<p>And I attribute this to the presence of a mother ship, however you might choose to label it. It creates a power relationship that I believe is a roadblock to a lot of good things. I know of examples in the last few weeks where the power relationship caused appalling problems with some of the foremost community members &ndash; situations that would never have happened in a relationship of equals. (I&rsquo;m being discreet for a reason; I don&rsquo;t want to cause any more heartache for those involved. Let&rsquo;s just leave it at &ldquo;the entire community suffered as a result.&rdquo;) This kind of thing has been happening for <em>years</em>.</p>

<p>I firmly believe those who would truly participate in open source must recognize that there is no true meeting of the minds, unless everyone is an equal. Not just &ldquo;treated as an equal&rdquo; &ndash; if you hold the power, then <em>you can&rsquo;t be an equal</em>, no matter how you try to treat others. Anyone who tries to be &ldquo;more equal&rdquo; than others is poisoning the well. The only solution I see is to <a href="http://www.xaprb.com/blog/2009/03/08/making-maatkit-more-open-source-one-step-at-a-time/">divest oneself of power</a>.</p>

<p>I think there are <a href="http://www.xaprb.com/blog/2007/08/12/what-would-make-me-buy-mysql-enterprise/">a lot of opportunities</a> here for everyone involved. And those who are best placed to take those opportunities, but don&rsquo;t, merely create a vacuum that draws others in to do it in their stead. And that&rsquo;s why I think that ultimately, the mother ship structure is not only unnecessary and sometimes detrimental, but may even become irrelevant.</p>

<p>I will be very curious to see how things change in the future. MySQL has a lot going for it: an incredible team of talented, dedicated employees; visionary leaders; unprecedented technology landscape; economic conditions &ndash; it&rsquo;s an enviable position. What I&rsquo;m most interested in is to see how they will nurture the <a href="http://www.xaprb.com/blog/2008/05/14/mysql-free-software-but-not-open-source/">open-source nature of the product</a>, which is its greatest strength &ndash; if it is teased out of the closed-source models that have bound it so tightly in recent years. The good news is, I think it&rsquo;s theirs to lose; they can win if they play it right, but the rest of us win no matter what.</p>

<p>The day we see an <a href="http://mysqlha.blogspot.com/2009/04/hack-on-drizzle-get-paid.html">announcement like this one</a> for MySQL will be a great day indeed.</p>
