<p>Some unsettling things happened in MySQL in the past week or so.</p>

<h3 id="toc_0">New storage engine not mentioned in the changelog</h3>

<p>There&rsquo;s a bit of a storm brewing over at the MySQL Performance Blog, where <a href="http://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/2009/04/06/mysql-and-ibm/">Vadim reports discovering a new storage engine</a> added without mention in the <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/news-5-1-33.html">5.1.33 changelog</a>. This is in defiance of the policy of not making changes in a production release. And it certainly belongs in the changelog &ndash; but there is no sign that anyone will remedy this problem.</p>

<p>Arjen Lentz, who is ex-MySQL and was Employee #25, <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/44172">reported a bug on the licensing of this storage engine</a>. To my eyes, the engine&rsquo;s license does not look right to include in a GPL database. Arjen agrees.</p>

<p>But the bug report he entered is now marked secret. This is a great way to draw attention to it. Now I&rsquo;m wondering: does this have something to do with the <a href="http:/http://www.xaprb.com/blogs.mysql.com/kaj/2008/12/01/mysql-51-release-schedule/">MySQL 5.1 community/enterprise split that was announced last year</a> but hasn&rsquo;t been implemented yet? Maybe they&rsquo;re going to unwrap something at the conference this year, <a href="http://jcole.ushttp://www.xaprb.com/blog/archives/2008/04/14/just-announced-mysql-to-launch-new-features-only-in-mysql-enterprise/">like they did last year</a>? I hope not. That was unpleasant and should not be repeated.</p>

<h3 id="toc_1">Three private bug reports in the changelog</h3>

<p>I noticed one private bug report in the 5.1.33 changelog itself. I wrote to the author of the 5.1.33 release announcement about it 3 days ago, but have received no response.</p>

<p>So after seeing that Arjen&rsquo;s report was private, I just clicked through all the bugs mentioned in the 5.1.33 changelog and found two more that I&rsquo;m barred from viewing. Here are all three:</p>

<pre>* The MD5 algorithm now uses the Xfree implementation.
   (Bug#42434: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/42434">http://bugs.mysql.com/42434</a>)
 * Use of USE INDEX hints could cause EXPLAIN EXTENDED to crash.
   (Bug#43354: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/43354">http://bugs.mysql.com/43354</a>)
 * MySQL 5.1 crashed with index merge algorithm and merge tables.
   A query in the MyISAM merge table caused a crash if the index
   merge algorithm was being used.
   (Bug#40675: <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/40675">http://bugs.mysql.com/40675</a>)
</pre>

<p>What reason can there be to make those private? I would like to encourage MySQL to discontinue this practice except when vitally necessary to protect client data. In my opinion, when someone submits a private bug to a software project that wants to be open-source, there should be a strong push-back. Private client data can go into a private comment; the whole bug report doesn&rsquo;t have to be sealed off. Consider the harm caused by private bug reports: it&rsquo;s now much harder for me to see what changeset fixed the bug. I can&rsquo;t see any of the discussion about it. I can&rsquo;t make any decisions about whether it affects me or clients.</p>

<p>I am concerned about the lack of openness and transparency in all of these issues, and others have told me that they are too.</p>
