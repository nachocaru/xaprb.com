      <p>I haven&rsquo;t really decided my schedule yet during the <a href="http://www.mysqlconf.com/">conference</a>, but I thought I&rsquo;d mention these sessions that look interesting to me.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m presenting a session on <a href="http://www.mysqlconf.com/mysql2009/public/schedule/detail/5677">how to use Maatkit</a>, which I think attendees will get a lot of benefit from.</p>

<ul>
<li>Tuesday

<ul>
<li>This is Not a Web App: The Evolution of a MySQL Deployment at Google (keynote). Mark Callaghan, need I say more?</li>
<li>MySQL and Search at Craigslist. Jeremy has gotten back into technical work after a career at Yahoo! that seemed to lead him away from his heart&rsquo;s desire. I&rsquo;d like to hear about the things he&rsquo;s done, especially since I understand it involves replacing a lot of overloaded MySQL machines with a few underloaded Sphinx machines.</li>
<li>Distributed Innodb Caching with memcached. Matt and Yves have been doing really ground-breaking work here. It might not seem revolutionary, but it is: they&rsquo;re dipping their toes into the future when optimizing code for slow, sequential-access disks is a crime.</li>
<li>Rethinking MySQL, Enter Drizzle. I doubt I&rsquo;ll be able to get in the door for this one.</li>
<li>If You Love It, Break It: Testing MySQL with the Random Query Generator. Ah, that sounds nifty.</li>
<li>The PBXT Storage Engine: Meeting Future Challenges. I continue to watch PBXT keenly. IMO it is one of the key storage engines of the future.</li>
<li>Advanced Query Manipulation with MySQL Proxy. Proxy is a tool that&rsquo;ll only become more useful in the future, too.</li>
<li>Introduction to Using DTrace with MySQL. I&rsquo;d like to learn about DTrace.</li>
<li>Solving Common SQL Problems with the SeqEngine. It&rsquo;s Beat Vontobel &ndash; he always amazes and delights the audience.</li>
<li>MySQL Proxy Meets: Binlogs. Hmm, I think there&rsquo;s a lot going on behind the scenes here. I think Jan is being shy and has something really nifty to unwrap.</li>
<li>Understanding and Control of MySQL Query Optimizer: Traditional and Novel Tools and Techniques. Sergey&rsquo;s talks are always interesting for true propeller heads.</li>
<li>Faster Data Reduction and Smoothing for Analysis &#038; Archival in MySQL. I think a lot of my clients could benefit from this!</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Wednesday

<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://conferences.percona.com/">Percona Performance Conference</a>. From 8:30 AM to 10:30 PM, and I think every single session is a must-see. But I&rsquo;m biased, because I helped pick sessions.</li>
<li>Using Q4M: A Message Queue Storage Engine for MySQL. Queues are one of the hardest design patterns to scale with traditional techniques. Anyone who has a queue (jobs to process, comments to moderate, articles to approve, clicks to aggregate, &ldquo;stuff to do and then mark as done&rdquo;) should get something from this.</li>
<li>libdrizzle: A New Client Library for Drizzle and MySQL. I really think the Drizzle developers&rsquo; work will have far-reaching impacts.</li>
<li>Monitoring 101: Simple Stuff to Save Your Bacon. What it says.</li>
<li>High Availability and Scalability Patches from Google. Good luck fitting in the door on this one, too.</li>
<li>SAN Performance on a Internal Disk Budget: The Coming Solid State Disk Revolution. More from Matt Yonkovit.</li>
<li>Innodb Database Recovery Techniques. Obligatory plug &ndash; Peter Zaitsev.</li>
<li>MySQL Performance on EC2. Mark Callaghan? Mark Callaghan! But I have not a clue about this one. I didn&rsquo;t know he was into EC2. Google doesn&rsquo;t outsource their infrastructure, do they?</li>
<li>There are several time slots on Wednesday when there is nothing of great interest to me. I will be at the Maatkit dot-org booth in the expo hall during this time, or maybe at the Percona conference.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Thursday

<ul>
<li>More Percona Performance Conference. Fill your brain! More, more, more!</li>
<li>Deep-inspecting MySQL with DTrace. I can&rsquo;t decide whether this or the earlier one is likely to be better. Domas is a wizard.</li>
<li>Map/Reduce and Queues for MySQL Using Gearman. Gearman is something I have my eyes on &ndash; either that or Spread. For a secret project.</li>
<li>MySQL Support Internals. They run a world-class operation and they&rsquo;re my competition.</li>
<li>Dormando&rsquo;s Proxy for MySQL. Just because.</li>
<li>Advanced Master-Slave Replication with Tungsten Failover. I keep meaning to evaluate this, but haven&rsquo;t had time.</li>
<li>Memory Management in MySQL and Drizzle. A specialized topic, and Stewart knows a lot of stuff.</li>
<li>memcached Functions for MySQL: Seemless Caching in MySQL. There&rsquo;s a lot of neat stuff here.</li>
<li>MySQL Row Change Event Extraction and Publish. From Google. What else are they up to?</li>
<li>InnoDB Performance and Usability Patches. By Vadim. This is a must-see for anyone who wants leading edge InnoDB features and performance. Percona&rsquo;s work isn&rsquo;t very well documented (yet) so this will be a great way to learn about the stuff we&rsquo;ve done that you might not otherwise find out.</li>
<li>SPIDER Storage Engine: Database Sharding by Storage Engine. This one is interesting. It looks like Federated with parallelism and potentially other features. I looked at the source, but it is really unclear to me what it does, and there is nary a comment to be found.</li>
<li><strong>Make Your Life Easier with Maatkit</strong>. I think I&rsquo;ll attend this one, since I&rsquo;m presenting.
I&rsquo;ll be spreading my time out over a lot of different things, and I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll be getting much sleep at the conference, so I&rsquo;ll have to see what I can fit in. But these are the sessions I think look the most interesting.</li>
</ul></li>
