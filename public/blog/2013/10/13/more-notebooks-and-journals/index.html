<p>Something interesting happened after I published my <a href="http://www.xaprb.com/blog/2013/07/10/ultimate-notebook-and-journal-face-off/" title="Ultimate notebook and journal face-off">ultimate notebook and journal face-off</a> blog post a couple of months ago. I received an email from a company called <a href="http://www.grandluxe.com/online-store.html">Grandluxe</a>, asking if I&rsquo;d like to receive some stationery products in hopes that if I liked them, I&rsquo;d write a review on them. I had never heard of them before, but they&rsquo;ve been making paper products for 68 years, and apparently are trying to break out of the Asian market into international territory.</p>

<p>I agreed, and they sent me quite a large box of notebooks. They also sent me their full product line catalog. So you could say that, as a notebook nerd, I&rsquo;m in heaven!</p>

<p>I really like the products. (I&rsquo;ve already disclosed my bias. But I&rsquo;ll do it again. I was given these free of charge.)</p>

<h3 id="toc_0">Monologue Ruled Notebook</h3>

<p>They sent me an entire set of the <a href="http://www.grandluxe.com/index.php/online-store/monologue-ruled-note-book-a5.html">Monologue</a> ruled notebook in A5 size, assorted attractive colors. It is very similar to a Moleskine-class notebook. It has a slightly softer and more &ldquo;grippy&rdquo; cover, but otherwise there&rsquo;s little difference. I had enough to give one to my wife, to each of my coworkers, and keep the prettiest color for myself.</p>

<h3 id="toc_1">Mythology Notebook</h3>

<p>I received three small (A6) and one A5 in this product line. The paper is a little smoother and the edges are gilded in gold and silver colors. The covers are charcoal black with silvery/goldish undertones. They are hard and stiff, not soft and flexible like the Monologue, and have a knurled or bumpy feel. The spine is embossed with the product name in gilding to match the edge of the sheets. The A5 has a pseudo-reptile-skin pattern on the binding. These would make a great gift or promotional item, because they look really sophisticated. Note that the colors in the image below are a little exaggerated; in reality the gold/silver tones are more subtle.</p>

<p>This item doesn&rsquo;t seem to be available on their online store yet, but you can find more details and images <a href="http://www.grandluxe.com/notebooks-journals.html">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="toc_2">Monolette Notebook</h3>

<p>This is a slim notebook with a flexible cover (thick paper, not rigid at all) that comes in combination packs. Each pack has one ruled notebook and one blank notebook with perforated pages for easy tear-out.</p>

<h3 id="toc_3">Bullet Journaling</h3>

<p>I recently stumbled on an interesting system of journaling / note-taking called <a href="http://www.bulletjournal.com/">Bullet Journal</a>. Although it&rsquo;s a little bit over-the-top in some ways, and sometimes feels like being told the obvious or told to follow a system that seems unlikely to hold together in the &ldquo;real world,&rdquo; it is fun to see that other people enjoy taking notes on paper as much as I do. Worth a read.</p>

<h3 id="toc_4">Conclusion</h3>

<p>There&rsquo;s an embarrassment of riches to choose from when it comes to journals and notebooks, and my bookshelf is stockpiled with a couple of years&rsquo; worth now that I&rsquo;ve done this epic series. But in today&rsquo;s digital world, can you ever get too much of good old paper and pen? Enjoy the simpler pleasures&hellip; I hope this blog has helped with that a little bit.</p>
