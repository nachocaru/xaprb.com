  <p>Here&rsquo;s a trip down memory lane. I was just cleaning out some stuff and I found some notes I took from a hilarious MySQL seminar a few years back. I won&rsquo;t say when or where, to protect the guilty.[1]</p>

<p>I found it so absurd that I had to write down what I was witnessing. Enough time has passed that we can probably all laugh about this now. Times and people have changed.</p>

<p>The seminar was a sales pitch in disguise, of course. The speakers were singing Powerpoint Karaoke to slides real tech people had written. Every now and then, when they advanced a slide, they must have had a panicked moment. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember this slide at all!&rdquo; they must have been thinking. So they&rsquo;d mumble something really funny and trying-too-hard-to-be-casual about &ldquo;oh, yeah, [insert topic here] but you all already know this, I won&rsquo;t bore you with the details [advance slide hastily].&rdquo; It&rsquo;s strange how transparent that is to the audience.</p>

<p>Here are some of the things the sales &ldquo;engineers&rdquo; said during this seminar, in response to audience questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Q. How does auto-increment work in replication? A: On slaves, you have to ALTER TABLE to remove auto-increment because only one table in a cluster can be auto-increment. When you switch replication to a different master you have to ALTER TABLE on all servers in the whole cluster to add/remove auto-increment. (This lie was told early in the day. Each successive person who took a turn presenting built upon it instead of correcting it. I&rsquo;m not sure whether this was admirable teamwork or cowardly face-saving.)</li>
<li>Q. Does InnoDB&rsquo;s log grow forever? A: Yes. You have to back up, delete, and restore your database if you want to shrink it.</li>
<li>Q. What size sort buffer should I have? A: 128MB is the suggested starting point. You want this sucker to be BIG. </ul></li>
</ul>

<p>There was more, but that&rsquo;s enough for a chuckle. Note to sales engineers everywhere: beware the guy in the front row scribbling notes and grinning.</p>

<p>What are your best memories of worst sales engineer moments?</p>

<p><em>1. For the avoidance of doubt, it was NOT any of the trainers, support staff, consultants, or otherwise anyone prominently visible to the community. Nor was it anyone else whose name I&rsquo;ve mentioned before. I doubt any readers of this blog, except for former MySQL AB employees (pre-Sun), would have ever heard of these people. I had to think hard to remember who those names belonged to.</em></p>
