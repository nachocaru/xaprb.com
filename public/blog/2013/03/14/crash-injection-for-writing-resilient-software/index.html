  <p>I am currently finishing some features to make a program highly resilient to occasional crashing bugs. A particular function was found to crash on queries of the form <code>WHERE x IN(NULL)</code>, and that crashed the entire program. Now we have a framework for intelligently recovering from arbitrary crashes. I will write more on this in the future, because I think it&rsquo;s a very interesting thing to share.</p>

<p>In this episode, I want to focus on a related topic: how do you test a program that is supposed to be resilient to bugs you can&rsquo;t predict? Many new problems are caused by writing <a href="http://www.xaprb.com/blog/2011/05/04/whats-wrong-with-mmm/" title="What’s wrong with MMM?">clever code that is supposed to detect, avoid, or recover from problems</a>, even known problems. Unknown problems are even riskier.</p>

<p>The approach that has given me a great deal of confidence in the &ldquo;resilience framework&rdquo; is to write a &ldquo;crash injection framework.&rdquo; (If it&rsquo;s not a framework, it can&rsquo;t be any good, right?) Crash injection can be activated at runtime to cause crashes in arbitrary source code locations. A fairly simple analysis of the source code showed me some places I&rsquo;m particularly interested in crashing to see how the program reacts.</p>

<p>In the first iteration, it turned out that I hadn&rsquo;t actually solved the problem, even though I was sure I had. (I had already discovered previous mistakes, so this was actually about the 3rd time through, and I was sure I&rsquo;d found all the bits I&rsquo;d previously missed.) My crash injection framework allowed me to quickly dispel the notion that my program was resilient to the kinds of bugs we&rsquo;d already found.</p>

<p>The fix was simple, but the lesson was well learned. I don&rsquo;t remember doing this before, but I&rsquo;ve studied and admired other pieces of software that are built to be resilient. For example, CouchDB has a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crash-only_software">crash-only</a> design. If you&rsquo;re not familiar with that phrase, it&rsquo;s well worth reading more about that. Stewart Smith has also written software that helps reveal wrong assumptions, such as <a href="http://flamingspork.com/projects/libeatmydata/">libeatmydata</a>, and I think he also wrote something that randomly broke <code>malloc()</code>, but I can&rsquo;t find that easily. Assumptions like &ldquo;allocating memory will always succeed&rdquo; are great places to end up with horrible bugs.</p>

<p>In the MySQL world, it would be great if we had more crash-injection testing of InnoDB as well. If you agree, you might consider subscribing to <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php">http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php</a> to keep up to date with effort on that front.</p>
