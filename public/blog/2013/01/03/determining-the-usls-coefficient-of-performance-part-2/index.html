  <p><a href="http://www.xaprb.com/blog/2013/01/02/determining-the-universal-scalability-laws-coefficient-of-performance/" title="Determining the Universal Scalability Law’s coefficient of performance">Last time</a> I said that the USL has a forgotten third coefficient, the coefficient of performance. This is the same thing as the system&rsquo;s throughput at concurrency=1, or C(1). How do you determine this coefficient? There are at least three ways.</p>

<p>Neil Gunther&rsquo;s writings, or at least those that I&rsquo;ve read and remember, say that you should set it equal to your measurement of C(1). Most of his writing discusses a handful of measurements of the system: one at concurrency 1, and at least 4 to 6 at higher concurrencies. I can&rsquo;t remember a time when he&rsquo;s discussed taking more than one measurement of throughput at each level of concurrency, so I think the assumption is that you&rsquo;re going to take a single measurement at various concurrencies (or, in the case of hardware scalability, units of hardware), and you&rsquo;re done.</p>

<p>This tends to work quite well. I&rsquo;ve blogged before about this: well-designed systems, measured in a carefully controlled test, tend to match the Universal Scalability Law model quite well. Here are <a href="http://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/2011/01/26/modeling-innodb-scalability-on-multi-core-servers/">two</a> <a href="http://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/2011/02/28/is-voltdb-really-as-scalable-as-they-claim/">examples</a>.
Most systems I model aren&rsquo;t like that. I don&rsquo;t do my modeling in a lab. I get thousands, if not tens or hundreds of thousands, of measurements of throughput and concurrency from a MySQL server&rsquo;s real production traffic. How do you determine the system&rsquo;s throughput at concurrency=1 in this kind of situation? You may have hundreds or thousands of samples at or near concurrency=1, and here&rsquo;s the interesting thing: they aren&rsquo;t tightly clustered. This leads to the two additional techniques I&rsquo;ve used.</p>

<p>Method 2 is fairly obvious: you can take an aggregate measure of the throughput at N=1. You can simply average, or you can use the median. In my experience, the latter tends to be a little more accurate, because the median essentially discards outliers. Given enough samples, it is very likely that the median is truly representative of the system&rsquo;s real behavior.</p>

<p>Finally, method 3 is to treat C(1) as one of the parameters to fit in the regression to the USL model. Instead of holding it as a fixed quantity, go ahead and let the regression find the best fit for it along with the other coefficients.</p>

<p>In practice, I tend to combine methods 2 and 3. I use method 2 to find a starting point for the coefficient, and then I let the regression tweak it as needed. In my experience, this usually produces good results. Sometimes the software doing the regression gets a little confused, or stuck at a local maximum, but otherwise it works well.</p>

<p>What if you don&rsquo;t have measurements at N=1? The best approach, in my experience, is to take the slope of the line from the first data point you have, and use that. N=1 will almost always be higher than this, because real systems are rarely linearly scalable. That&rsquo;s okay. If you let the regression adjust the coefficient as needed for the best fit, you&rsquo;ll end up with a good answer anyway.</p>
