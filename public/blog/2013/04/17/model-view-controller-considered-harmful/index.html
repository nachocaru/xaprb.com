      <p>In 2001 I created a PHP 4 web application framework from scratch as the backbone of a sophisticated application. Back then frameworks weren&rsquo;t cool. Smarty templates were the hotness.</p>

<p>My framework had URL routing, templates with a capable templating syntax similar to mustache, loosely coupled and tightly cohesive object-oriented design, an elegant way to access the database without dumbing it down, and nicely separated business logic and presentation layers &ndash; among many other nice things you find in good frameworks. As the application grew more and more complex, the framework continued to serve well with only occasional enhancements.</p>

<p>I mention this because it illustrates that I&rsquo;ve been aware of how to design maintainable systems for a long time. But the so-called MVC paradigm (model, view, controller) has <em>never</em> made sense to me.</p>

<p>The design goals make sense. See above. It&rsquo;s just that I find MVC itself &ndash; the abstraction and implementation of those goals &ndash; to be unhelpful at best, on a day I&rsquo;m being charitable. On a day I&rsquo;m telling it like it is, I&rsquo;ll just bluntly say MVC is the most confusing pile of acronym bulls**t I can think of.</p>

<p>Tell me, without knowing what MVC is, what would you guess the model represents? Controller? View? It would be bad enough if these were abstract terms like &ldquo;node&rdquo; or &ldquo;resource,&rdquo; but they&rsquo;re not abstract. They hint at meaning, and then you discover that MVC doesn&rsquo;t align with the hinted-at meaning. Instead, the M, V, and C represent concepts that are vague and hard to understand, and are kind of a stretch to mentally fit with the terms. This is worse than abstract, it&rsquo;s misleading. It&rsquo;s like bait-and-switch for someone who&rsquo;s trying to grasp what it means.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know where MVC came from and I&rsquo;m sure I won&rsquo;t change my mind if I find out. I have a hard time believing that I&rsquo;m the only one who wishes someone had formed a committee[1] to discuss what kind of names to represent the concepts. Especially since there are so many frameworks that abstract things slightly differently, because MVC apparently doesn&rsquo;t suit their designers either, and thus it&rsquo;s necessary to explain the relationship between Framework X&rsquo;s view of the world, and how that loosely maps to the MVC view of the world. It becomes a sloppy comparison to a sloppy analogy.</p>

<p>Even more fun: some folks try to invent an MVC framework, like the original ASP.NET, and &ldquo;get it wrong,&rdquo; to disdainful criticism. Then they have to reinvent it, sometimes several times.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like the OSI 7-layer model, which everyone agrees doesn&rsquo;t actually represent modern networking technology stacks cleanly, and yet everyone talks about the OSI layers. There&rsquo;s a clean way to think about networking layers, but the OSI model ain&rsquo;t it. Or NoSQL &ndash; the most unhelpful, undescriptive name for an &hellip; amorphous category of technologies or worldviews or design patterns or whatever&hellip; ever.</p>

<p>The lesson: great concepts that teach great truths, and could result in great advances in engineering due to a common mental model around which other things can be built, can be sidetracked by slapping an ill-fitting monicker or set of analogies on them. And sometimes we never seem to get another chance. NoSQL believers can&rsquo;t seem to think of anything better than NoSQL as a name (and neither can I, as much as I deplore the NoSQL name). We&rsquo;re stuck.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure my strong opinions on this are a) somewhat ignorant and b) not shared by everyone. Discuss! :-)</p>

<p>[1] Yes, I&rsquo;m aware that awful things come from committees, like SQL. But I have faith that it would have been better than MVC.</p>
