  <h1>Percona Live MySQL Conference in a few weeks!</h1>

      <p>I&rsquo;m really looking forward to <a href="http://www.percona.com/live/">Percona Live</a> this year. I will be there, along with Kyle Redinger, my co-founder at <a href="https://vividcortex.com/">VividCortex</a>. I feel that this year the conference has come full circle. 2007 was my first year at the conference, and it was amazing. This year is tremendously exciting for me because it feels like we&rsquo;re back on the 2007 trajectory.</p>

<p>Those were the golden days. Things were a little sad in 2010 and 2011 as the MySQL community tried to figure out the new landscape and O&rsquo;Reilly decided to stop running the event, but then in 2012 we all said &ldquo;we&rsquo;re back!&rdquo; with the exception of Oracle, who instead arranged MySQL Connect, as part of Oracle Open World. I don&rsquo;t think that was a huge success. I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s why Oracle has decided to participate in this year&rsquo;s Percona MySQL conference, but frankly it doesn&rsquo;t matter. What matters is that they&rsquo;re there. Oracle is a vital part of the MySQL community and if we didn&rsquo;t have them it would be a huge loss.</p>

<p>I think I already said this in a previous blog post, but the <a href="http://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2013/program/schedule/sessions-day-1">schedule</a> is freaking amazing. I have never seen a conference &ndash; <em>any</em> conference &ndash; with such a high-quality session schedule. To get this many concentrated high-quality sessions you usually have to attend a mega-conference with dozens of sessions at a time, most of them fluff.</p>

<p>I also have to give Percona a huge thank-you for seeing this through. I was involved &ndash; but only slightly &ndash; in the 2012 conference, and I can tell you that no outsider can possibly understand the amount of time, money, and work involved. I heard some people say things like &ldquo;oh yeah, I&rsquo;ve organized a big event, I know what&rsquo;s required&rdquo; followed by descriptions of &ldquo;cost&rdquo; and &ldquo;difficulty&rdquo; that made me laugh. The conference Percona is organizing is unimaginably more expensive and difficult. If you want to say thank-you, I know they will be glad to hear it. The committee will also. And let&rsquo;s give credit to the sponsors, too. It&rsquo;s a ton of effort and expense for all of them.</p>

<p>Are you going to be there? If not, what the heck is wrong with you? Seriously. If you are involved with MySQL at all, if you use it, if your company uses it &ndash; you need to be there. If you haven&rsquo;t been in 2007, 2008, or 2012, there&rsquo;s no way you can understand what you&rsquo;re missing. You need to take my word and show up. Percona is making it ridiculously cheap &ndash; I don&rsquo;t know if they&rsquo;re even making money at the price they&rsquo;re charging. The value of that week in Santa Clara is hard to calculate. Just go.</p>
