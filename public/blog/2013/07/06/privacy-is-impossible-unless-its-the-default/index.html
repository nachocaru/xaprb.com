  <h1>Privacy is impossible unless it&#39;s the default</h1>

      <p>This is a follow-up to my last post, in which I asserted that <a href="http://www.xaprb.com/blog/2013/07/05/without-free-software-and-hardware-privacy-is-impossible/" title="without free software and hardware, privacy is impossible">without free software and hardware, privacy is impossible</a>. Suppose we have trustworthy, free hardware and software. What else is needed to thwart efforts to monitor our everyday behavior on a massive scale?</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s look only at one activity that&rsquo;s currently being monitored: email. How can we make email less vulnerable to prying eyes?</p>

<p>Technology to encrypt email between ordinary citizens (PGP, OpenPGP, and <a href="http://www.gnupg.org/">GnuPG</a>) has existed for years, and in a form strong enough to frustrate any known attempts at decryption. The encrypted emails can be decrypted, but it requires a brute-force effort of computing, which would take far too long with available computers.</p>

<p>But if you and I use this technology right now to encrypt our communications, we&rsquo;ll actually make ourselves more interesting targets. That&rsquo;s partially because we&rsquo;d be among the few people doing so. Have you ever noticed that nothing draws attention like whispering in a public place? I don&rsquo;t know what proportion of ordinary email between everyday people is encrypted, but if pressed, I&rsquo;d guess it&rsquo;s fewer than one email in 50,000. That&rsquo;s an extraordinarily strong signal to authorities looking for needles in the haystack of Internet activity. I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if the NSA has large-scale brute-force encryption-cracking clusters dedicated to forcibly decrypting the few encrypted emails that wend their way around the Internet.</p>

<p>But what if <em>everyone</em> sent encrypted email? Then it wouldn&rsquo;t be remarkable. Those little <em>hi hon, do you need me to pick up groceries on the way home?</em> emails I send would be as common as more weighty ones. Brute-forcing may be feasible on a small scale, but I doubt that even un-guessed-at techniques and availability of powerful computers could brute-force decryption on the scale of the whole of the Internet&rsquo;s email. The NSA, unable to determine whose emails to decrypt, would have to settle for snooping on a smaller scale, or giving up.</p>

<p>What would it take for everyone to use encryption in their emails? It is practically impossible, and thus certainly won&rsquo;t happen, unless all email software makes it <em>the default behavior</em>. And since most people use email software from companies such as Apple, Microsoft, and Google, this will not happen. Even if these companies wanted to make such software encrypt-by-default, I am absolutely certain that they would be secretly barred from doing so. (Plus, as I&rsquo;ve said in my earlier article, their software would not be trustworthy and we&rsquo;d be spied upon in other ways. Why spy on email software when you can spy on the whole operating system?)</p>

<p>Email encryption would also have to be a lot simpler and more automatic. Most computer users, in my opinion, can&rsquo;t understand the concepts of public and private key pairs, how to generate them, how to exchange them, how to know if another person&rsquo;s key should be trusted, and so on. Even HTTPS is baffling to most computer users &ndash; and the only thing they&rsquo;re exposed to is their browser&rsquo;s address bar and the presence or absence of a lock icon, a much simpler thing to understand. Yet a majority of people still get it wrong and expose themselves to phishing attacks, viruses, and other scams. This is not a criticism of them; it&rsquo;s a criticism of the technology. Security technology is way, way too hard for everyday people to use. Thus we&rsquo;ll never have mass encryption unless something fundamentally changes in how we do it.</p>

<p>Even if we had mass adoption of encryption, there are a couple of things that would make it easier for the NSA to continue spying on us. Once they decrypt one message, they&rsquo;d have the key to decrypt future emails to that same recipient. So over time they&rsquo;d be able to snoop on more and more people. Encryption keys would have to be rotated regularly to frustrate this. For this, and other technological reasons, absolutely everything would have to &ldquo;just work&rdquo; without any need for manual configuration or intervention. If a human has to do something like rotate an encryption key, it won&rsquo;t happen. Anyone experienced with backups knows what I mean.</p>

<p>The other is that only the body of the email message is encrypted. The subject, sender, recipient, IP addresses, and a surprising variety of other data would be unprotected. This is too much for my comfort. It&rsquo;s essentially equivalent to the so-called metadata they&rsquo;ve been collecting from Verizon, for example (caller, callee, time of call, and so on).</p>

<p>The bottom line is that we are using technologies such as email that were never designed to be resistant to the snooping now occurring. Email encryption is a bolt-on afterthought. It&rsquo;s not feasible society-wide, by default, for all users; and on a smaller scale, it helps identify interesting snoop-worthy targets. And thus there&rsquo;s really nothing we can do that will make government monitoring of email impossible.</p>

<p>In a future post I&rsquo;ll broaden this topic beyond email.</p>
