- consolidate categories a bit more (mysql, monitoring, scalability,
  performance seem to need tweaking)
- create paginated archives (monthly/yearly archives somehow too?)
- move all images into the blog
- look for missing reference links with [brackets]
- find and move everything in /articles
- images on reviews
- remove things like the footnotes in http://localhost:1313/blog/2006-11-02-how-to-create-input-masks-in-html/
